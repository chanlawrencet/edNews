ARTICLE:Homeland Security secretary gets shredded on Twitter after she lies about policy that separates families at borderAs the debate rages on about the Trump administration's horrific policy of separating undocumented parents from their children as they attempt to cross the border between the United States and Mexico, the fight between officials and lawmakers has spilled over onto social media.

One tweet, in particular, from Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen, has served as a flashpoint. She tweeted on Sunday that the DHS doesn't "have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."

We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period. — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018

But images and videos across social media as well as a plethora of well-reported stories have offered substantial evidence to the contrary, relaying stories and even showing tent cities created for undocumented children separated from their families.

Here are photos of the tent city near El Paso that is housing immigrant children separated from their parents. Photos by @i_p_a_1 for the @TexasTribune.

Just visited the Brownsville Children's Facility. Trump Administration didn't let us talk to the kids and they even tried to stop me from recording outside the building. They are clearly sensitive about this trip. This place is packed with kids—over 100 taken from parents. pic.twitter.com/7RVP0ZgT8e — Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) June 18, 2018

What's more, journalists and lawmakers made note of previous comments Nielsen has made in defense of the same policy she tweeted doesn't exist.

"Nielsen said the department has ... a policy that it will refer everyone caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, even if they ... have small children. Any parents who are prosecuted ... will be separated from their children in the process." https://t.co/PiCVLVA2aF https://t.co/Nfs9a3oxxx — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 17, 2018

Nielsen didn't exactly help herself, either, on Monday morning by saying, "We will not apologize for doing out job."

Lawmakers have jumped in, calling out Nielsen and her statement, labeling it a lie, and challenging both the Trump administration and Nielsen to address the growing crisis that is spiraling out of control.

Retract this statement, Madame Secretary.



Yes, technically YOU are not at the border separating families YOURSELF. You are in charge of a policy that turns parents over to DOJ, resulting in the separation of children. You know this, and still - incredibly - sent out this tweet. https://t.co/CikreZ286K — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) June 18, 2018

This is a lie. There is no law. There is no court mandate. This is a policy made solely by this administration, and you can stop it right now.

While it's mostly been Democrats reacting to Nielsen's statement, some Republicans, including former First Lady Laura Bush, have publicly opposed the Trump administration's policy.

As of Monday morning, though, Trump was back on Twitter himself and, though he didn't address Nielsen's comments directly, he did address the issue but in the most horrendous way, continuing to blame Democrats.

Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border.

The Discharge Petition that cleared the Senate in May is struggling in the House (as we knew it would).

The petition needs 218 House signatures to force a vote on whether to overrule Ajit Pai and the FCC and bring back Net Neutrality. It's been stalled at 172 for two weeks.

Here's how to check where your rep stands. You can use the same tool to call your lawmaker and remind them that there's an election coming up and you don't appreciate anyone fucking with your internet, and you'll remember who stood up for Big Telco when the polls open.

A discharge petition needs 218 signatures to force a House vote on the same net neutrality bill, and 218 votes would also be enough to pass the measure. So far, the petition has signatures from 172 representatives, all Democrats. That number hasn't changed in two weeks. "We're 46 [signatures] away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order," Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted yesterday.

On June 19 — during National Ocean Month — President Donald Trump revoked Obama-era protections for U.S. oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters. (Matt Anderson Photography / Getty Images)

In proclaiming June National Ocean Month, President Donald Trump called on the nation to “reflect on the value and importance of oceans” and “celebrate this immense natural resource.”

But this week, in the midst of that celebration, he signed an executive order to revoke Obama-era protections for U.S. oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters. Trump’s directive focuses on energy extraction, fishing, trade and national security, further highlighting that he believes that the greatest value of federal lands and waters lies in the commodities that can be harvested from them.

“Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy,” reads the order, which Trump signed Tuesday. “Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nation’s security and reduces reliance on imported energy.”

Missing from the order are words like “conservation,” “stewardship” and “climate change,” as well as any mention of numerous other threats facing the world’s oceans, including plastic pollution, coral bleaching and acidification.

Signed in 2010 in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill, Barack Obama’s executive order established a federal policy for protecting, maintaining and restoring ocean health and biodiversity.

“America’s stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and national and homeland security,” the Obama order states.

While the fishing and offshore energy industries celebrated Trump’s rollback, environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers were quick to blast the move.

Jacqueline Savitz, the chief policy officer for the nonprofit group Oceana, said the new order “undercuts important conservation measures needed to support strong coastal economies.”

“Every decision involving the ocean also affects fish, wildlife and water quality with resulting costs or benefits for coastal communities, fisheries and tourism,” she said in a statement. “We need strong national policies to help restore our fisheries and protect our oceans.”

In a Twitter post, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called Trump’s declaration of National Ocean Month “a nice sheen” on an ocean policy that could lead to another massive oil spill.

Declaring June National Ocean Month is a nice sheen on Trump’s ocean policy, but between opening up 90% of our coasts to offshore drilling and now repealing the #NationalOceanPolicy, his admin is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill.https://t.co/LlAoUfVPIy — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) June 20, 2018

During National Ocean Month in 2017, Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, signed by nearly 200 countries in an effort to help prevent global temperatures from increasing by 2 degrees Celsius, the magic number scientists say the world must stay below to prevent the worst effects of climate change.ARTICLE:Uber, Waymo and others to study the 'human impact' of self-driving cars"Concern for the safety of workers and the public is paramount to PTIO," Executive Director Maureen Westphal told The Verge, "and safe deployment of [autonomous vehicle] technology is fundamental to securing better job opportunities for workers, so we plan to engage with a variety of concerned stakeholders already having conversations and planning for this transition to an autonomous vehicle future."

In 2016, some of these same companies formed another group, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which advocates for self-driving technology. Ford, Waymo, Lyft, Uber and Volvo make up its members. Westphal told The Verge that though the coalition is doing important work, "the Partnership for Transportation Innovation and Opportunity believes that while society prepares for the practical impact of autonomous vehicles, we must also focus our efforts on the human impact as it relates to Americans' careers and jobs."

Westphal says part of the goal of PTIO is to foster debate about issues surrounding the acceptance of self-driving vehicles. "Our hope is that in doing so we will help bring consensus around some proactive policies and initiatives that help ensure everyone benefits from these technological innovations. At the same time, we realize by promoting debate we may generate conversations that are uncomfortable for some stakeholders, including our members," she said.

Last month, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sent letters to over two dozen companies working on self-driving technology inquiring into safety and testing procedures.ARTICLE:Effort To Save Net Neutrality Via Congressional Review Act Appears Stuck In NeutralEfforts to reverse the FCC's historically unpopular attack on net neutrality using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) appear stuck in neutral.

The CRA lets Congress reverse a regulatory action with a simply majority vote in the Senate and the House (which is how the GOP successfully killed FCC privacy protections last year). And while the Senate voted 52 to 47 back in May to reverse the FCC's attack on net neutrality, companion efforts to set up a similar vote in the House don't appear to be gaining much traction as the clock continues to tick. A discharge petition needs 218 votes to even see floor time, and another 218 votes to pass the measure.

But so far, the petition only currently has 172 likely votes, all Democrats:

Again, not a single Republican in the House has signaled any interest in saving net neutrality. As we've long noted, the quest for a healthy internet free from anti-competitive meddling by telecom monopolies has long been idiotically framed as a partisan issue despite broad, bipartisan consumer support. ISPs and their numerous political proxy organizations have long enjoyed using rhetoric that only further fuels these divisions (derailing real consensus) by conflating meaningful consumer protections with a "government takeover of the internet," ideas that are happily parroted by many ISP cash-loving DC lawmakers.

Undaunted, net neutrality activists held an advocacy day yesterday trying to drum up some additional support among lawmakers among a clearly debate-fatigued public. Another net neutrality group, Fight for the Future, has constructed this page to track which lawmakers haven't signed on, while making it easy to contact those that haven't.

That said, this effort was always an uphill climb. Even if the CRA vote succeeded in the House, it would have to avoid a veto by Trump. Many activists I've spoken to believe a vote in both Houses would appeal to Trump's "populist" streak forcing him to bend to the whims of public consensus. But given Trump's version of populism tends to be as authentic as a Hollywood Wild West set and as consistent as a brush fire, that prediction always seemed a tad optimistic. Still, stranger things have happened, so maintaining hope in the face of this level of corruption isn't entirely outrageous.

That said, the best path forward for reversing the repeal is two fold. One, there remains a notable chance that the courts see the FCC's fraud-riddled net neutrality repeal as the blatant, facts-optional nonsense it actually is, and reverses it for being an "arbitrary and capricious" abuse of procedural norms and the FCC's obligation to represent the public. If that doesn't work, there's always voting in the the midterms and thereafter for a new breed of lawmakers that don't mindlessly place ISP campaign contributions above the welfare of the public, the internet, and genuine, healthy competition.ARTICLE:Orlando Airport Will Scan the Faces of All International Travelers — Including US CitizensAdvertiser Disclosure

US residents and elected officials alike still have their eyes on Facebook as concerns continue to circulate over the policies that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Further, more recent reports have revealed that the company shared data with a number of mobile device makers, sparking unease over what that means for consumers as well as national security. On the other side of the issue, Europe has now instituted its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the most rigorous set of privacy laws to date. Now, it looks like US officials are interested in exploring some regulations of their own.

Axios reports that Gail Slater, special assistant to President Trump for tech, telecom and cyber policy at the White House National Economic Council, is looking into what sorts of regulations, if any, should and could be implemented in the country. According to Axios sources, she has met with the CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, the trade group that represents companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, as well as members of the technology committee of The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group made up of US CEOs including Apple's Tim Cook, IBM's Virginia Rometty and Verizon's Lowell McAdam.

While it's still quite early in this process, these conversations could eventually lead to some sort of regulatory framework in the US. Axios sources say one possibility is an executive order directing the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop privacy standards. Another is a public-private partnership that could take on the issue.

It's likely that whatever US officials come up with, it won't be a copy of Europe's GDPR. Slater has already noted that while some parts of Europe's new laws -- like giving consumers more control over their online data -- are appealing, other stipulations, such as the "right to be forgotten" might not mesh with US laws. "We're talking through what, if anything, the administration could and should be doing," Slater said at a conference last month.

Following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced a privacy bill called the CONSENT Act while Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Kennedy (R-LA) followed suit with their Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, California is working on a Consumer Privacy Act, which a number of tech companies are opposing. Additionally, some US lawmakers have called on tech companies to work with them to develop adequate and effective legislation. "I'll be the first to acknowledge that if the tech companies leave it to policy makers in Washington alone to figure this out, we'll probably screw it up," Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) told CNET in April.

The mass protest was one of several demonstrations that erupted across the country, providing a taste of what are expected to be much larger demonstrations on Saturday called by the Women’s March and the Center for Popular Democracy Action. The rallies are likely to get a further boost as a result of the announcement on Wednesday by Anthony Kennedy that he is retiring from the US supreme court, providing Trump with the chance to make a second ultra-conservative appointment to the nation’s highest court and prompting fears of a rollback of liberal protections.

The largest demonstration on Thursday saw the 90ft atrium of the Hart Senate office building overrun by hundreds of women who sat on the floor pumping their fists in the air. Many were draped in foil sheets as a statement on the flimsy bedding given to children and adults as they are held at US border detention facilities.

The protesters chanted “abolish Ice” and “we care” – a jab at Melania Trump for wearing a jacket with the words “I really don’t care, do U?” painted on its back as she visited one of the immigrant detention centers in Texas last week.

Among those arrested in the Senate building were Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic member of Congress representing Seattle. She said in a video posted on social media that she had joined the action to protest against “the inhumane and cruel ‘zero-tolerance’ policy of Donald Trump and this administration, the separation of families, the caging of children, and the imprisonment of asylum seekers”.

She added that she was proud to have been arrested among hundreds of others who believed that “the US is better and as a member of Congress I refuse to let this president and administration do what they are doing to children in my name”.

Daily images are still emerging of distraught immigrant children separated from parents and not yet reunited, despite an executive order last week ending the policy of summarily tearing families apart and arresting the adults after anyone is caught crossing the border illegally.

In a written statement, the Capitol police said about 575 people were charged with unlawfully demonstrating inside the office building. The police said those arrested were being released after they were processed.

Winnie Wong, political adviser for the Women’s March, said the crowd’s fervor would translate into “the energy we will need to see at the ballot box in November”, when congressional control will be at stake.

The Democratic senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was one of the first to draw attention to children being held in detention camps along the border after being separated from their parents, appeared before the crowd. So did the Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Edward Markey of Massachusetts.

“These folks are out here fighting for the core principles of our nation, and I applaud them for it,” Merkley said in an interview.

Meanwhile, hundreds more people gathered at a rally outside a federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande valley.

And dozens of protesters shut down a government meeting in Michigan in protest against a contract with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency to house detainees at a local jail. Eight people also were arrested outside an Ice building in Portland, Oregon, that has been closed because of a round-the-clock demonstration.ARTICLE:After Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset in NY, can Ayanna Pressley pull off a repeat in Massachusetts? - Washington Post

Massachusetts congressional candidate Ayanna Pressley sent one of her campaign aides to New York last week to help get out the vote for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who stunned national Democrats Tuesday by toppling veteran Rep. Joseph Crowley.

Now Pressley is hoping to become the next giant-slayer in this year’s midterms. The first black woman to serve on the Boston City Council, Pressley, 44, is challenging Rep. Michael Capuano, 66, a 10-term incumbent in Massachusetts’ 7th District.

In the same way that Ocasio-Cortez defied the odds to defeat Crowley, a 10-term veteran who also is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, Pressley is looking to prove political handicappers wrong by defeating Capuano in the Sept. 4 primary.

Pressley congratulated Ocasio-Cortez Tuesday night in a tweet featuring a picture of the two insurgent candidates.

A huge congrats to @Ocasio2018 for your victory tonight! You proved that when we stand up for what we believe in, we win. This is about more than one campaign or election. This is a movement. Together, we will change the world. Congratulations! #ChangeCantWait #Ocasio2018 pic.twitter.com/imORpc1jST — Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) June 27, 2018

Ocasio-Cortez responded by urging support for Pressley.

“The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.”

- @AyannaPressley.



Vote her in next, Massachusetts.



There are more of us, too: @CoriBush, @Chardo2018, @AyannaPressley & more.



We need to elect a corporate PAC-free caucus if we’re going to get things done. https://t.co/M2tF5cedTs — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) June 27, 2018

In a statement Wednesday, Pressley said that Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign has been “dynamic and inspiring, and it’s about more than one election — it’s about building a movement of people standing up and demanding to be heard.”

[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Democrat who challenged her party’s establishment and won]

She also said that “[t]he job description for Representatives in Congress has changed. In deep blue districts like New York’s 14th and the Massachusetts 7th, voters are asking for more than a reliable vote — they are asking for committed, activist leadership.”

Pressley has struggled to make the case for why voters should replace Capuano with her, as both have similar positions on economic and social issues and have been vocal critics of the Trump administration’s policies. Earlier this week, Pressley called for defunding the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which she said “is creating an atmosphere of toxic fear and mistrust in immigrant communities.” Last weekend Capuano was part of a delegation of Democratic lawmakers who toured a detention center at the U.S.-Mexico border.

After Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise victory, social media was abuzz about Pressley’s race, which also hasn’t gotten much attention beyond the fact that she is part of a surge of young Democratic women candidates running for Congress this year, fueled by the #MeToo movement and disapproval with President Trump.

Both also are women of color who are challenging older white men representing districts that are majority minority. Both women have suggested that they have the life experiences and sensibilities to better serve the residents of those communities. Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Latina, was a bartender before launching her congressional campaign. Pressley was raised by a single mother and has said she was raped when she was in college.

Massachusetts’ 7th District, which includes most of Boston and portions Cambridge and Milton, as well as Chelsea and Somerville, is close to 60 percent minority. If Pressley were to win the primary and the general election, she would be the first African American woman to represent the Bay State in Congress.

Yet the historic nature of Pressley’s candidacy has not been a rallying point for black political leaders. Deval Patrick, who was elected Massachusetts governor in 2006 — and became the nation’s second elected African American governor — has endorsed Capuano. Patrick praised Pressley, though not by name, in a statement but said that Capuano “believed in me when few others would take a chance on a novice candidate.” He added that “Mike was with me in the trenches.”

The Congressional Black Caucus political action committee also is supporting the incumbent. “Civil rights are under attack, and we need to fight back. Rep. Capuano has built his career on standing up for those who have been left behind,” Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), chairman of the PAC said in a statement.

[These women have won their primaries. Will they be elected in November?]

Capuano is considered a reliable liberal, which is why most major groups on the left are sticking with him. The state’s two Democratic senators — Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey — have so far remained neutral in the race.

He has more than $1.1 million cash on hand, according to the most recent campaign filing, while Pressley reported $259,633 on hand.

Pressley has been endorsed by some local political leaders and grass-roots organizations. But EMILY’s List, which tapped Pressley for its Rising Star Award in 2015 is not backing her.

Higher Heights for America, which encourages black women to run for elected office, is helping to rally support for Pressley among African American women around the country.

Glynda C. Carr, co-founder of the group, said Tuesday’s upset in New York “demonstrated that all seats are truly in play and that voters are looking for candidates that are ready to lead in this moment.”

Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, Rutgers’ Eagleton Institute of Politics, said it’s difficult to say what Ocasio-Cortez’s victory means for Pressley.

But one immediate benefit is more media attention as activists and pundits ponder whether the similar profiles of the contests could mean another upset. “It will be interesting to track whether that yields more fundraising and support in other ways,” Dittmar said.ARTICLE:Fla. airport set to be first to require face scans for all international passengers—even US citizensThe Orlando International Airport will become the first in the nation to require face scans for all passengers – including U.S. citizens – who are arriving or departing on international flights, according to The Associated Press.

The announcement, coming from officials at Florida’s busiest airport, is raising concerns among some privacy advocates. One reason is the lack of rules for cataloging the face scans. Also, no rules exist for dealing with passengers who are wrongly prevented from boarding a flight, according to the report.

Do other airports have similar policies?

Airports in “Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington,” require face scans for some departing international flights, but not for all international flights, the report states. At these airports, the Department of Homeland Security allows U.S. citizens to opt out of face scans.

But the agency is not necessarily informing Americans about that option, Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University Law Center, told the AP.

Face scan images are essentially a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that keeps track of who should be on a flight.

Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection told The Associated Press that U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport will also be able to opt out.

But a notice about the rule change at Orlando indicates “U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States,” according to the report.

Rudolph said the change at Orlando means many more people will submit to face scans.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” Rudolph said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

How many people could this involve?

Last year, the Orlando International Airport had about six million international passengers, the report states.

Another concern is that the face scans tend to be inaccurate for racial minorities, women and children, Rudolph said. That is partly because the photos “used to train the face-scanning software,” under-represents those demographics.

Last month, two U.S. senators sent a letter to the DHS, which oversees the border patrol. The senators urged that rules be established before the program goes into effect.

“It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport,” the letter from U.S. Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) said.ARTICLE:House Democrats are 46 signatures short in their bid to save net neutralityIn context: Net neutrality was a set of online protections that prevented ISPs from throttling or blocking access to certain websites, among other things. Those protections were rolled back by the FCC in a controversial December 14 vote, but now Democrats are attempting to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Commission's decision.

Back in December, the FCC under Chairman Ajit Pai controversially voted to roll back Title II net neutrality protections. For the unaware, these protections prevented telecom companies from throttling your internet traffic or offering some websites paid prioritization over others.

However, Democrats weren't going to let net neutrality go without a fight. In May, the US Senate voted to overturn the FCC's decision by using the Congressional Review Act (CRA). This vote was seen as a significant victory by many net neutrality proponents.

Unfortunately for those individuals, the fight is far from over. The next step in the CRA is a forced Congress vote, which would require net neutrality supporters to gather 218 signatures on a "discharge petition." So far, they only have 172 signatures, all of which have come from Democrats.

The House #NetNeutrality discharge petition is at 172 signatures. We’re 46 away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order.

That puts pro-net neutrality voters 46 signatures short of their goal. Even if they were to persuade the remaining Democrats -- of which there are 21 -- to vote in their favor, net neutrality supporters would still need an additional 25 Republicans to sign off on the discharge petition.

If that wasn't enough of a roadblock to the successful repeal of the FCC's December 14 vote, the CRA still requires approval from President Trump, who can veto the Act when it crosses his desk.

Even if the CRA fails, though, all is not lost. Individual states can always attempt to implement their own strong net neutrality protections, though they may face federal pressure in doing so.ARTICLE:Orlando International Airport to Scan Faces of US CitizensFlorida’s busiest airport will be the first in the country to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights.

Officials there say all passengers, including U.S. citizens, will be scanned.

Orlando International Airport’s expected policy worries some privacy advocates. They say there are no rules in place for dealing with the information taken from the scans. Also, there is no system for assisting a passenger who is wrongly prevented from getting on an airplane.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights. However, they do not scan all international travelers like the airport in Orlando plans to do.

The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database. The department has images of people to confirm travelers’ identities.

Harrison Rudolph is with the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center. He said U.S. citizens at these airports can refuse to be scanned. But the agency does not seem to be letting people know they can refuse, he noted.

Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, wrote the Associated Press about the policy. U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport can refuse to be scanned if they do not want to provide their photograph, she wrote. However, a notice about a possible rule change for the program says “U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States.”

Rudolph said the Orlando announcement marks an increase in the face scan program.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” he said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year.

Rudolph said he is worried about the face scans’ exactness. Some research shows they are less exact with racial minorities, women and children. Some researchers say this is because pictures used in the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Last month, two U.S. senators sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Mike Lee of Utah urged that official rules be put in place before the program is expanded.

Official rules, the senators explained, would help Americans understand and accept the program. They noted that this is important because it would affect every American leaving the country by airport.

But in the aftermath of the leak of millions of people’s data to the Donald Trump-linked analytics firm, privacy concerns shot to the forefront of the public consciousness—and to the top of many lawmakers’ to-do lists. Concern was perhaps the most pronounced in California, the tech mecca and home to Silicon Valley itself. And so Alastair MacTaggart, a San Francisco-based real-estate developer, began to circulate a petition advocating for a California Consumer Privacy Act, a bill that would force tech companies into disclosing what exactly they did with personal user data. Some $3 million and more than 600,000 signatures later, MacTaggart gave lawmakers a choice: pass a privacy bill, or his initiative would go to ballot in November. “If the bill passes before [Thursday], we will withdraw our initiative. If it doesn’t, we will proceed to the November election,” he said in a statement earlier this week. “We are content either way, as we feel that both the legislative solution, and our initiative, provide tremendously increased privacy rights to Californians.”

On Thursday, lawmakers obliged, passing the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and propelling America one step further down the path to its own version of G.D.P.R. In the country’s most populous state, the act will likely dramatically alter how businesses handle user data. Beginning in 2020, everyone from big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google down to smaller businesses will be required to disclose the kinds of data they collect from users and give to third parties, including advertisers. What was passed is slightly different from MacTaggart’s initiative: instead of requiring companies to disclose the identity of third parties that receive information about a user, the bill requires only the disclosure of the “category” of the third party. Consumers will be able to see the sources from which companies collect data about them and can opt out of having their data sold altogether, and businesses will be prohibited from selling the data of anyone younger than 16. In its current form, if companies fail to adhere to these guidelines, they can be sued by the state attorney general.

Tech giants had initially expressed opposition to the effort, though they eventually decided to compromise on the bill instead of attempting to fight it. Facebook Vice President Will Castleberry told Axios that while “not perfect, we support” the law, and an industry trade group called the Internet Association, which represents tech entities like Uber, Facebook, and Amazon, said it wouldn’t obstruct the proposal. “Maintaining people’s privacy and security has always been and remains a top priority of internet platforms,” Internet Association Vice President of State Government Affairs Robert Callahan said on Thursday after the bill’s passage. “Trust with IA member products and services is essential . . . and the internet industry is committed to providing people with information and tools to make informed choices about how their personal information is used, seen, and shared online.”

If tech companies maintain their stance, California’s law could set a new standard for the rest of the United States. For big companies like Facebook and Google, it may be more attractive to comply with California’s standards in every state, rather than attempting to maintain two different sets of rules: one for California, and one for the rest of the country. “Between the Europeans and California, we’re starting to move towards having a universal privacy bill of rights, and I just think it’s going to create a precedent that ultimately is going to be a national standard,” Senator Ed Markey told Axios on Thursday. Markey’s optimism, however, could be premature—the rules aren’t slated to take effect until 2020, giving corporate lobbyists plenty of time to wage aggressive campaigns to water them down.

Others are concerned that the bill doesn’t adequately address privacy concerns in the first place, or that it could backfire. Under its terms, tech companies are prohibited from offering lower-quality service to users who opt out of having their data sold to third parties; however, the rules stipulate that an I.S.P. or tech company could still charge them more. “I believe this path to pay for privacy is a dangerous and slippery slope,” state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, a supporter of the bill, told The Washington Post. “This is a hastily drafted, bad bill that won’t protect Californians’ privacy,” the A.C.L.U. of Northern California tweeted. “We’ll be back next year to make sure the legislature gets it right.”ARTICLE:Florida airport becomes first to require face scans for all passengersORLANDO, Fla. -- Florida's busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, including U.S. citizens, according to officials there. The expected announcement Thursday at Orlando International Airport alarms some privacy advocates who say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don't involve all international travelers at the airports like the program's expansion in Orlando would. The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has images of people who should be on the flight, in order to verify the traveler's identity.

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency "doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport -- which had about 6 million international passengers in the past year -- will be able to opt out just like at the other airports if they don't want to provide their photograph, Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in an email. However, a notice about a possible rule change for the program states that "U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States."

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

"We're not talking about one gate," he said. "We're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up."

In seconds, facial recognition technology can compare a picture taken at the gate against a flier's passport picture stored in a government database. Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans' accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Two U.S. senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

"It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport," said the letter from U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.

As CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave has reported, more than 2 million people move through the nation's airports per day, and airlines have been testing new technology to improve security and speed up the boarding process.

New biometric technology has expanded beyond boarding. Delta announced last year it would launch a self-service bag drop powered by facial recognition technology -- the first of its kind at U.S. airports. There's also Clear, a private company that stores and verifies customers' biometrics, allowing fliers to go to the front of the security line at 24 airports nationwide.

"Marrying all of the technologies at each of the steps in the travel ribbon is a game changer for the experience," said Gareth Joyce, senior vice president of airport customer service and president of cargo at Delta. "You can literally go from, you know, curb to plane without having to interact with a human being if you so desire."ARTICLE:Homeland Security secretary gets shredded on Twitter after she lies about policy that separates families at borderAs the debate rages on about the Trump administration's horrific policy of separating undocumented parents from their children as they attempt to cross the border between the United States and Mexico, the fight between officials and lawmakers has spilled over onto social media.

On June 19 — during National Ocean Month — President Donald Trump revoked Obama-era protections for U.S. oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters.

In proclaiming June National Ocean Month, President Donald Trump called on the nation to “reflect on the value and importance of oceans” and “celebrate this immense natural resource.”

But this week, in the midst of that celebration, he signed an executive order to revoke Obama-era protections for U.S. oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters. Trump’s directive focuses on energy extraction, fishing, trade and national security, further highlighting that he believes that the greatest value of federal lands and waters lies in the commodities that can be harvested from them.

“Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy,” reads the order, which Trump signed Tuesday. “Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nation’s security and reduces reliance on imported energy.”

Missing from the order are words like “conservation,” “stewardship” and “climate change,” as well as any mention of numerous other threats facing the world’s oceans, including plastic pollution, coral bleaching and acidification.

Signed in 2010 in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill, Barack Obama’s executive order established a federal policy for protecting, maintaining and restoring ocean health and biodiversity.

“America’s stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and national and homeland security,” the Obama order states.

While the fishing and offshore energy industries celebrated Trump’s rollback, environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers were quick to blast the move.

Jacqueline Savitz, the chief policy officer for the nonprofit group Oceana, said the new order “undercuts important conservation measures needed to support strong coastal economies.”

“Every decision involving the ocean also affects fish, wildlife and water quality with resulting costs or benefits for coastal communities, fisheries and tourism,” she said in a statement. “We need strong national policies to help restore our fisheries and protect our oceans.”

In a Twitter post, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called Trump’s declaration of National Ocean Month “a nice sheen” on an ocean policy that could lead to another massive oil spill.

Declaring June National Ocean Month is a nice sheen on Trump’s ocean policy, but between opening up 90% of our coasts to offshore drilling and now repealing the #NationalOceanPolicy, his admin is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill.https://t.co/LlAoUfVPIy — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) June 20, 2018ARTICLE:Homeland Security secretary gets shredded on Twitter after she lies about policy that separates families at borderAs the debate rages on about the Trump administration's horrific policy of separating undocumented parents from their children as they attempt to cross the border between the United States and Mexico, the fight between officials and lawmakers has spilled over onto social media.

While it's mostly been Democrats reacting to Nielsen's statement, some Republicans, including former First Lady Laura Bush, have publicly opposed the Trump administration's policy.

The Discharge Petition that cleared the Senate in May is struggling in the House (as we knew it would).

The petition needs 218 House signatures to force a vote on whether to overrule Ajit Pai and the FCC and bring back Net Neutrality. It's been stalled at 172 for two weeks.

"We're 46 [signatures] away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order," Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted yesterday.

During National Ocean Month in 2017, Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, signed by nearly 200 countries in an effort to help prevent global temperatures from increasing by 2 degrees Celsius, the magic number scientists say the world must stay below to prevent the worst effects of climate change.ARTICLE:Uber, Waymo and others to study the 'human impact' of self-driving cars"Concern for the safety of workers and the public is paramount to PTIO," Executive Director Maureen Westphal told The Verge, "and safe deployment of [autonomous vehicle] technology is fundamental to securing better job opportunities for workers, so we plan to engage with a variety of concerned stakeholders already having conversations and planning for this transition to an autonomous vehicle future."

In 2016, some of these same companies formed another group, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which advocates for self-driving technology. Ford, Waymo, Lyft, Uber and Volvo make up its members. Westphal told The Verge that though the coalition is doing important work, "the Partnership for Transportation Innovation and Opportunity believes that while society prepares for the practical impact of autonomous vehicles, we must also focus our efforts on the human impact as it relates to Americans' careers and jobs."

Westphal says part of the goal of PTIO is to foster debate about issues surrounding the acceptance of self-driving vehicles. "Our hope is that in doing so we will help bring consensus around some proactive policies and initiatives that help ensure everyone benefits from these technological innovations. At the same time, we realize by promoting debate we may generate conversations that are uncomfortable for some stakeholders, including our members," she said.

Last month, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sent letters to over two dozen companies working on self-driving technology inquiring into safety and testing procedures.ARTICLE:Effort To Save Net Neutrality Via Congressional Review Act Appears Stuck In NeutralEfforts to reverse the FCC's historically unpopular attack on net neutrality using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) appear stuck in neutral.

The CRA lets Congress reverse a regulatory action with a simply majority vote in the Senate and the House (which is how the GOP successfully killed FCC privacy protections last year). And while the Senate voted 52 to 47 back in May to reverse the FCC's attack on net neutrality, companion efforts to set up a similar vote in the House don't appear to be gaining much traction as the clock continues to tick. A discharge petition needs 218 votes to even see floor time, and another 218 votes to pass the measure.

But so far, the petition only currently has 172 likely votes, all Democrats:

Again, not a single Republican in the House has signaled any interest in saving net neutrality. As we've long noted, the quest for a healthy internet free from anti-competitive meddling by telecom monopolies has long been idiotically framed as a partisan issue despite broad, bipartisan consumer support. ISPs and their numerous political proxy organizations have long enjoyed using rhetoric that only further fuels these divisions (derailing real consensus) by conflating meaningful consumer protections with a "government takeover of the internet," ideas that are happily parroted by many ISP cash-loving DC lawmakers.

Undaunted, net neutrality activists held an advocacy day yesterday trying to drum up some additional support among lawmakers among a clearly debate-fatigued public. Another net neutrality group, Fight for the Future, has constructed this page to track which lawmakers haven't signed on, while making it easy to contact those that haven't.

That said, this effort was always an uphill climb. Even if the CRA vote succeeded in the House, it would have to avoid a veto by Trump. Many activists I've spoken to believe a vote in both Houses would appeal to Trump's "populist" streak forcing him to bend to the whims of public consensus. But given Trump's version of populism tends to be as authentic as a Hollywood Wild West set and as consistent as a brush fire, that prediction always seemed a tad optimistic. Still, stranger things have happened, so maintaining hope in the face of this level of corruption isn't entirely outrageous.

That said, the best path forward for reversing the repeal is two fold. One, there remains a notable chance that the courts see the FCC's fraud-riddled net neutrality repeal as the blatant, facts-optional nonsense it actually is, and reverses it for being an "arbitrary and capricious" abuse of procedural norms and the FCC's obligation to represent the public. If that doesn't work, there's always voting in the the midterms and thereafter for a new breed of lawmakers that don't mindlessly place ISP campaign contributions above the welfare of the public, the internet, and genuine, healthy competition.ARTICLE:Orlando Airport Will Scan the Faces of All International Travelers — Including US CitizensAdvertiser Disclosure

US residents and elected officials alike still have their eyes on Facebook as concerns continue to circulate over the policies that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Further, more recent reports have revealed that the company shared data with a number of mobile device makers, sparking unease over what that means for consumers as well as national security. On the other side of the issue, Europe has now instituted its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the most rigorous set of privacy laws to date. Now, it looks like US officials are interested in exploring some regulations of their own.

Axios reports that Gail Slater, special assistant to President Trump for tech, telecom and cyber policy at the White House National Economic Council, is looking into what sorts of regulations, if any, should and could be implemented in the country. According to Axios sources, she has met with the CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, the trade group that represents companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, as well as members of the technology committee of The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group made up of US CEOs including Apple's Tim Cook, IBM's Virginia Rometty and Verizon's Lowell McAdam.

While it's still quite early in this process, these conversations could eventually lead to some sort of regulatory framework in the US. Axios sources say one possibility is an executive order directing the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop privacy standards. Another is a public-private partnership that could take on the issue.

It's likely that whatever US officials come up with, it won't be a copy of Europe's GDPR. Slater has already noted that while some parts of Europe's new laws -- like giving consumers more control over their online data -- are appealing, other stipulations, such as the "right to be forgotten" might not mesh with US laws. "We're talking through what, if anything, the administration could and should be doing," Slater said at a conference last month.

Following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced a privacy bill called the CONSENT Act while Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Kennedy (R-LA) followed suit with their Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, California is working on a Consumer Privacy Act, which a number of tech companies are opposing. Additionally, some US lawmakers have called on tech companies to work with them to develop adequate and effective legislation. "I'll be the first to acknowledge that if the tech companies leave it to policy makers in Washington alone to figure this out, we'll probably screw it up," Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) told CNET in April.

The mass protest was one of several demonstrations that erupted across the country, providing a taste of what are expected to be much larger demonstrations on Saturday called by the Women’s March and the Center for Popular Democracy Action. The rallies are likely to get a further boost as a result of the announcement on Wednesday by Anthony Kennedy that he is retiring from the US supreme court, providing Trump with the chance to make a second ultra-conservative appointment to the nation’s highest court and prompting fears of a rollback of liberal protections.

The largest demonstration on Thursday saw the 90ft atrium of the Hart Senate office building overrun by hundreds of women who sat on the floor pumping their fists in the air. Many were draped in foil sheets as a statement on the flimsy bedding given to children and adults as they are held at US border detention facilities.

The protesters chanted “abolish Ice” and “we care” – a jab at Melania Trump for wearing a jacket with the words “I really don’t care, do U?” painted on its back as she visited one of the immigrant detention centers in Texas last week.

Among those arrested in the Senate building were Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic member of Congress representing Seattle. She said in a video posted on social media that she had joined the action to protest against “the inhumane and cruel ‘zero-tolerance’ policy of Donald Trump and this administration, the separation of families, the caging of children, and the imprisonment of asylum seekers”.

She added that she was proud to have been arrested among hundreds of others who believed that “the US is better and as a member of Congress I refuse to let this president and administration do what they are doing to children in my name”.

Daily images are still emerging of distraught immigrant children separated from parents and not yet reunited, despite an executive order last week ending the policy of summarily tearing families apart and arresting the adults after anyone is caught crossing the border illegally.

In a written statement, the Capitol police said about 575 people were charged with unlawfully demonstrating inside the office building. The police said those arrested were being released after they were processed.

Winnie Wong, political adviser for the Women’s March, said the crowd’s fervor would translate into “the energy we will need to see at the ballot box in November”, when congressional control will be at stake.

The Democratic senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was one of the first to draw attention to children being held in detention camps along the border after being separated from their parents, appeared before the crowd. So did the Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Edward Markey of Massachusetts.

“These folks are out here fighting for the core principles of our nation, and I applaud them for it,” Merkley said in an interview.

Meanwhile, hundreds more people gathered at a rally outside a federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, in the Rio Grande valley.

And dozens of protesters shut down a government meeting in Michigan in protest against a contract with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency to house detainees at a local jail. Eight people also were arrested outside an Ice building in Portland, Oregon, that has been closed because of a round-the-clock demonstration.ARTICLE:After Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset in NY, can Ayanna Pressley pull off a repeat in Massachusetts? - Washington Post

Massachusetts congressional candidate Ayanna Pressley sent one of her campaign aides to New York last week to help get out the vote for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who stunned national Democrats Tuesday by toppling veteran Rep. Joseph Crowley.

Now Pressley is hoping to become the next giant-slayer in this year’s midterms. The first black woman to serve on the Boston City Council, Pressley, 44, is challenging Rep. Michael Capuano, 66, a 10-term incumbent in Massachusetts’ 7th District.

In the same way that Ocasio-Cortez defied the odds to defeat Crowley, a 10-term veteran who also is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, Pressley is looking to prove political handicappers wrong by defeating Capuano in the Sept. 4 primary.

Pressley congratulated Ocasio-Cortez Tuesday night in a tweet featuring a picture of the two insurgent candidates.

A huge congrats to @Ocasio2018 for your victory tonight! You proved that when we stand up for what we believe in, we win. This is about more than one campaign or election. This is a movement. Together, we will change the world. Congratulations! #ChangeCantWait #Ocasio2018 pic.twitter.com/imORpc1jST — Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) June 27, 2018

Ocasio-Cortez responded by urging support for Pressley.

“The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.”

- @AyannaPressley.



Vote her in next, Massachusetts.



There are more of us, too: @CoriBush, @Chardo2018, @AyannaPressley & more.



We need to elect a corporate PAC-free caucus if we’re going to get things done. https://t.co/M2tF5cedTs — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) June 27, 2018

In a statement Wednesday, Pressley said that Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign has been “dynamic and inspiring, and it’s about more than one election — it’s about building a movement of people standing up and demanding to be heard.”

[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Democrat who challenged her party’s establishment and won]

She also said that “[t]he job description for Representatives in Congress has changed. In deep blue districts like New York’s 14th and the Massachusetts 7th, voters are asking for more than a reliable vote — they are asking for committed, activist leadership.”

Pressley has struggled to make the case for why voters should replace Capuano with her, as both have similar positions on economic and social issues and have been vocal critics of the Trump administration’s policies. Earlier this week, Pressley called for defunding the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which she said “is creating an atmosphere of toxic fear and mistrust in immigrant communities.” Last weekend Capuano was part of a delegation of Democratic lawmakers who toured a detention center at the U.S.-Mexico border.

After Ocasio-Cortez’s surprise victory, social media was abuzz about Pressley’s race, which also hasn’t gotten much attention beyond the fact that she is part of a surge of young Democratic women candidates running for Congress this year, fueled by the #MeToo movement and disapproval with President Trump.

Both also are women of color who are challenging older white men representing districts that are majority minority. Both women have suggested that they have the life experiences and sensibilities to better serve the residents of those communities. Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Latina, was a bartender before launching her congressional campaign. Pressley was raised by a single mother and has said she was raped when she was in college.

Massachusetts’ 7th District, which includes most of Boston and portions Cambridge and Milton, as well as Chelsea and Somerville, is close to 60 percent minority. If Pressley were to win the primary and the general election, she would be the first African American woman to represent the Bay State in Congress.

Yet the historic nature of Pressley’s candidacy has not been a rallying point for black political leaders. Deval Patrick, who was elected Massachusetts governor in 2006 — and became the nation’s second elected African American governor — has endorsed Capuano. Patrick praised Pressley, though not by name, in a statement but said that Capuano “believed in me when few others would take a chance on a novice candidate.” He added that “Mike was with me in the trenches.”

The Congressional Black Caucus political action committee also is supporting the incumbent. “Civil rights are under attack, and we need to fight back. Rep. Capuano has built his career on standing up for those who have been left behind,” Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), chairman of the PAC said in a statement.

[These women have won their primaries. Will they be elected in November?]

Capuano is considered a reliable liberal, which is why most major groups on the left are sticking with him. The state’s two Democratic senators — Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey — have so far remained neutral in the race.

He has more than $1.1 million cash on hand, according to the most recent campaign filing, while Pressley reported $259,633 on hand.

Pressley has been endorsed by some local political leaders and grass-roots organizations. But EMILY’s List, which tapped Pressley for its Rising Star Award in 2015 is not backing her.

Higher Heights for America, which encourages black women to run for elected office, is helping to rally support for Pressley among African American women around the country.

Glynda C. Carr, co-founder of the group, said Tuesday’s upset in New York “demonstrated that all seats are truly in play and that voters are looking for candidates that are ready to lead in this moment.”

Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University and scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics, Rutgers’ Eagleton Institute of Politics, said it’s difficult to say what Ocasio-Cortez’s victory means for Pressley.

But one immediate benefit is more media attention as activists and pundits ponder whether the similar profiles of the contests could mean another upset. “It will be interesting to track whether that yields more fundraising and support in other ways,” Dittmar said.ARTICLE:Fla. airport set to be first to require face scans for all international passengers—even US citizensThe Orlando International Airport will become the first in the nation to require face scans for all passengers – including U.S. citizens – who are arriving or departing on international flights, according to The Associated Press.

The announcement, coming from officials at Florida’s busiest airport, is raising concerns among some privacy advocates. One reason is the lack of rules for cataloging the face scans. Also, no rules exist for dealing with passengers who are wrongly prevented from boarding a flight, according to the report.

Do other airports have similar policies?

Airports in “Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington,” require face scans for some departing international flights, but not for all international flights, the report states. At these airports, the Department of Homeland Security allows U.S. citizens to opt out of face scans.

But the agency is not necessarily informing Americans about that option, Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University Law Center, told the AP.

Face scan images are essentially a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that keeps track of who should be on a flight.

Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection told The Associated Press that U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport will also be able to opt out.

But a notice about the rule change at Orlando indicates “U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States,” according to the report.

Rudolph said the change at Orlando means many more people will submit to face scans.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” Rudolph said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

How many people could this involve?

Last year, the Orlando International Airport had about six million international passengers, the report states.

Another concern is that the face scans tend to be inaccurate for racial minorities, women and children, Rudolph said. That is partly because the photos “used to train the face-scanning software,” under-represents those demographics.

Last month, two U.S. senators sent a letter to the DHS, which oversees the border patrol. The senators urged that rules be established before the program goes into effect.

“It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport,” the letter from U.S. Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) said.ARTICLE:House Democrats are 46 signatures short in their bid to save net neutralityIn context: Net neutrality was a set of online protections that prevented ISPs from throttling or blocking access to certain websites, among other things. Those protections were rolled back by the FCC in a controversial December 14 vote, but now Democrats are attempting to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Commission's decision.

Back in December, the FCC under Chairman Ajit Pai controversially voted to roll back Title II net neutrality protections. For the unaware, these protections prevented telecom companies from throttling your internet traffic or offering some websites paid prioritization over others.

However, Democrats weren't going to let net neutrality go without a fight. In May, the US Senate voted to overturn the FCC's decision by using the Congressional Review Act (CRA). This vote was seen as a significant victory by many net neutrality proponents.

Unfortunately for those individuals, the fight is far from over. The next step in the CRA is a forced Congress vote, which would require net neutrality supporters to gather 218 signatures on a "discharge petition." So far, they only have 172 signatures, all of which have come from Democrats.

The House #NetNeutrality discharge petition is at 172 signatures. We’re 46 away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order. Has your representative signed the petition to #SaveTheInternet? Check here: https://t.co/zKI7sxSwGj — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) June 26, 2018

That puts pro-net neutrality voters 46 signatures short of their goal. Even if they were to persuade the remaining Democrats -- of which there are 21 -- to vote in their favor, net neutrality supporters would still need an additional 25 Republicans to sign off on the discharge petition.

If that wasn't enough of a roadblock to the successful repeal of the FCC's December 14 vote, the CRA still requires approval from President Trump, who can veto the Act when it crosses his desk.

Even if the CRA fails, though, all is not lost. Individual states can always attempt to implement their own strong net neutrality protections, though they may face federal pressure in doing so.ARTICLE:Orlando International Airport to Scan Faces of US CitizensFlorida’s busiest airport will be the first in the country to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights.

Officials there say all passengers, including U.S. citizens, will be scanned.

Orlando International Airport’s expected policy worries some privacy advocates. They say there are no rules in place for dealing with the information taken from the scans. Also, there is no system for assisting a passenger who is wrongly prevented from getting on an airplane.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights. However, they do not scan all international travelers like the airport in Orlando plans to do.

The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database. The department has images of people to confirm travelers’ identities.

Harrison Rudolph is with the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center. He said U.S. citizens at these airports can refuse to be scanned. But the agency does not seem to be letting people know they can refuse, he noted.

Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, wrote the Associated Press about the policy. U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport can refuse to be scanned if they do not want to provide their photograph, she wrote. However, a notice about a possible rule change for the program says “U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States.”

Rudolph said the Orlando announcement marks an increase in the face scan program.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” he said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year.

Rudolph said he is worried about the face scans’ exactness. Some research shows they are less exact with racial minorities, women and children. Some researchers say this is because pictures used in the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Last month, two U.S. senators sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Mike Lee of Utah urged that official rules be put in place before the program is expanded.

Official rules, the senators explained, would help Americans understand and accept the program. They noted that this is important because it would affect every American leaving the country by airport.

But in the aftermath of the leak of millions of people’s data to the Donald Trump-linked analytics firm, privacy concerns shot to the forefront of the public consciousness—and to the top of many lawmakers’ to-do lists. Concern was perhaps the most pronounced in California, the tech mecca and home to Silicon Valley itself. And so Alastair MacTaggart, a San Francisco-based real-estate developer, began to circulate a petition advocating for a California Consumer Privacy Act, a bill that would force tech companies into disclosing what exactly they did with personal user data. Some $3 million and more than 600,000 signatures later, MacTaggart gave lawmakers a choice: pass a privacy bill, or his initiative would go to ballot in November. “If the bill passes before [Thursday], we will withdraw our initiative. If it doesn’t, we will proceed to the November election,” he said in a statement earlier this week. “We are content either way, as we feel that both the legislative solution, and our initiative, provide tremendously increased privacy rights to Californians.”

On Thursday, lawmakers obliged, passing the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and propelling America one step further down the path to its own version of G.D.P.R. In the country’s most populous state, the act will likely dramatically alter how businesses handle user data. Beginning in 2020, everyone from big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google down to smaller businesses will be required to disclose the kinds of data they collect from users and give to third parties, including advertisers. What was passed is slightly different from MacTaggart’s initiative: instead of requiring companies to disclose the identity of third parties that receive information about a user, the bill requires only the disclosure of the “category” of the third party. Consumers will be able to see the sources from which companies collect data about them and can opt out of having their data sold altogether, and businesses will be prohibited from selling the data of anyone younger than 16. In its current form, if companies fail to adhere to these guidelines, they can be sued by the state attorney general.

Tech giants had initially expressed opposition to the effort, though they eventually decided to compromise on the bill instead of attempting to fight it. Facebook Vice President Will Castleberry told Axios that while “not perfect, we support” the law, and an industry trade group called the Internet Association, which represents tech entities like Uber, Facebook, and Amazon, said it wouldn’t obstruct the proposal. “Maintaining people’s privacy and security has always been and remains a top priority of internet platforms,” Internet Association Vice President of State Government Affairs Robert Callahan said on Thursday after the bill’s passage. “Trust with IA member products and services is essential . . . and the internet industry is committed to providing people with information and tools to make informed choices about how their personal information is used, seen, and shared online.”

If tech companies maintain their stance, California’s law could set a new standard for the rest of the United States. For big companies like Facebook and Google, it may be more attractive to comply with California’s standards in every state, rather than attempting to maintain two different sets of rules: one for California, and one for the rest of the country. “Between the Europeans and California, we’re starting to move towards having a universal privacy bill of rights, and I just think it’s going to create a precedent that ultimately is going to be a national standard,” Senator Ed Markey told Axios on Thursday. Markey’s optimism, however, could be premature—the rules aren’t slated to take effect until 2020, giving corporate lobbyists plenty of time to wage aggressive campaigns to water them down.

Others are concerned that the bill doesn’t adequately address privacy concerns in the first place, or that it could backfire. Under its terms, tech companies are prohibited from offering lower-quality service to users who opt out of having their data sold to third parties; however, the rules stipulate that an I.S.P. or tech company could still charge them more. “I believe this path to pay for privacy is a dangerous and slippery slope,” state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, a supporter of the bill, told The Washington Post. “This is a hastily drafted, bad bill that won’t protect Californians’ privacy,” the A.C.L.U. of Northern California tweeted. “We’ll be back next year to make sure the legislature gets it right.”ARTICLE:Florida airport becomes first to require face scans for all passengersORLANDO, Fla. -- Florida's busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, including U.S. citizens, according to officials there. The expected announcement Thursday at Orlando International Airport alarms some privacy advocates who say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don't involve all international travelers at the airports like the program's expansion in Orlando would. The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has images of people who should be on the flight, in order to verify the traveler's identity.

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency "doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport -- which had about 6 million international passengers in the past year -- will be able to opt out just like at the other airports if they don't want to provide their photograph, Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in an email. However, a notice about a possible rule change for the program states that "U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States."

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

"We're not talking about one gate," he said. "We're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up."

In seconds, facial recognition technology can compare a picture taken at the gate against a flier's passport picture stored in a government database. Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans' accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Two U.S. senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

"It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport," said the letter from U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.

As CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave has reported, more than 2 million people move through the nation's airports per day, and airlines have been testing new technology to improve security and speed up the boarding process.

New biometric technology has expanded beyond boarding. Delta announced last year it would launch a self-service bag drop powered by facial recognition technology -- the first of its kind at U.S. airports. There's also Clear, a private company that stores and verifies customers' biometrics, allowing fliers to go to the front of the security line at 24 airports nationwide.

"Marrying all of the technologies at each of the steps in the travel ribbon is a game changer for the experience," said Gareth Joyce, senior vice president of airport customer service and president of cargo at Delta. "You can literally go from, you know, curb to plane without having to interact with a human being if you so desire."ARTICLE:Homeland Security secretary gets shredded on Twitter after she lies about policy that separates families at borderAs the debate rages on about the Trump administration's horrific policy of separating undocumented parents from their children as they attempt to cross the border between the United States and Mexico, the fight between officials and lawmakers has spilled over onto social media.

One tweet, in particular, from Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen, has served as a flashpoint. She tweeted on Sunday that the DHS doesn't "have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."

We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period. — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018

But images and videos across social media as well as a plethora of well-reported stories have offered substantial evidence to the contrary, relaying stories and even showing tent cities created for undocumented children separated from their families.

Here are photos of the tent city near El Paso that is housing immigrant children separated from their parents. Photos by @i_p_a_1 for the @TexasTribune.

What's more, journalists and lawmakers made note of previous comments Nielsen has made in defense of the same policy she tweeted doesn't exist.

Retract this statement, Madame Secretary.



Yes, technically YOU are not at the border separating families YOURSELF. You are in charge of a policy that turns parents over to DOJ, resulting in the separation of children. You know this, and still - incredibly - sent out this tweet. https://t.co/CikreZ286K

This is a lie. There is no law. There is no court mandate. This is a policy made solely by this administration, and you can stop it right now.

On June 19 — during National Ocean Month — President Donald Trump revoked Obama-era protections for U.S. oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters.

In proclaiming June National Ocean Month, President Donald Trump called on the nation to “reflect on the value and importance of oceans” and “celebrate this immense natural resource.”

But this week, in the midst of that celebration, he signed an executive order to revoke Obama-era protections for U.S. oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters. Trump’s directive focuses on energy extraction, fishing, trade and national security, further highlighting that he believes that the greatest value of federal lands and waters lies in the commodities that can be harvested from them.

“Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy,” reads the order, which Trump signed Tuesday. “Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nation’s security and reduces reliance on imported energy.”

Missing from the order are words like “conservation,” “stewardship” and “climate change,” as well as any mention of numerous other threats facing the world’s oceans, including plastic pollution, coral bleaching and acidification.

Signed in 2010 in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill, Barack Obama’s executive order established a federal policy for protecting, maintaining and restoring ocean health and biodiversity.

“America’s stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and national and homeland security,” the Obama order states.

While the fishing and offshore energy industries celebrated Trump’s rollback, environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers were quick to blast the move.

Jacqueline Savitz, the chief policy officer for the nonprofit group Oceana, said the new order “undercuts important conservation measures needed to support strong coastal economies.”

“Every decision involving the ocean also affects fish, wildlife and water quality with resulting costs or benefits for coastal communities, fisheries and tourism,” she said in a statement. “We need strong national policies to help restore our fisheries and protect our oceans.”

In a Twitter post, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) called Trump’s declaration of National Ocean Month “a nice sheen” on an ocean policy that could lead to another massive oil spill.

Declaring June National Ocean Month is a nice sheen on Trump’s ocean policy, but between opening up 90% of our coasts to offshore drilling and now repealing the #NationalOceanPolicy, his admin is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill.https://t.co/LlAoUfVPIy — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) June 20, 2018ARTICLE:‘Scheer Intelligence’: Do You Know Your Right of Publicity?In this week’s episode of “Scheer Intelligence,” host and Truthdig Editor in Chief Robert Scheer traces the shifting boundaries of publicity with someone who knows a thing or two about the topic. In fact, it’s fair to say his guest, Jennifer Rothman, wrote the book on it.

Rothman, a law professor at Loyola Law School, has been at the forefront of defining publicity, identity and privacy rules in the internet age. She’s done the work of sorting out the interrelated and tricky considerations involved in balancing self-promotion with self-protection at a time when image management has become an issue that isn’t reserved only for celebrities and elected officials.

Listen and learn from the expert herself in conversation with Scheer in the player below, and read the transcript that follows. Find past episodes of “Scheer Intelligence” here.

Robert Scheer: Hi, this is Robert Scheer, and you’re listening to Scheer Intelligence, kind of the poor man’s Central Intelligence Agency. My guest today is Loyola Law School professor and author Jennifer Rothman. Her latest book is called “The Right of Publicity: Privacy Reimagined for a Public World,” published by Harvard University Press. Jennifer Rothman, welcome.

Jennifer Rothman: Thank you.

RS: And the reason I wanted to do this interview is we had kind of a confusing panel about privacy and publicity at the Los Angeles Times Book Festival. And I thought after–you know, sometimes you just get off one of these panels–and I thought we were like ships passing in the night. I was stressing the surveillance state and privacy and the Fourth Amendment; and then we had a person, I’m blocking on his name, but he was very much into the technology, stressing that. And then you were coming from an area that I hadn’t thought much about, or if at all, and yet it’s incredibly important, because it concerns how much we know about people that otherwise are public people; they’re movie stars, they’re politicians, and their ability to control their image, I think, is the real issue, particularly in the time of the internet. Famously, the case of Martin Luther King, where his heirs can control even access to his speeches. And you’re kind of the maven of this in law, right? You’ve invented, or owned, or are the leading scholar in this area.

JR: Yeah, I don’t think I own this space, but I am known for being the leading scholar, and this is one of the first major treatments, book treatments of the subject. And the right of publicity is a law that most people don’t know about, but that affects all of us. And everyone actually has this right under state law; it’s the right to control your own identity, usually your likeness or voice or name. And you can stop others from using it, or collect money damages if they do without your permission. And this presents a host of opportunities in today’s digital age, where privacy has really fallen down on the job in many respects, because it narrowed over time to really just be, in the context of state laws, to really apply to secrets, or when people are secluded in their homes. But the right of publicity covers information that’s out in the public–your name, your likeness and voice–and so it’s not about secrecy or seclusion, it’s about control. So this has some opportunities for your average person to combat things like Facebook using you in advertisements, or selling information about you; it applies, you may be able to use it to stop revenge porn or deal with mugshot sites that are using arrest photos. But it also has a number of risks, and one of them you just highlighted, which is the ability of public figures to shut down speech about them, and shut down uses of their name and image and voice, which can shut down creative works like movies as well as internet discussions about public figures, and even the use of clips of Martin Luther King giving speeches.

RS: Yeah. So let me, first of all, you say it’s a matter of state law. So it varies from state to state?

JR: Yes.

RS: And so, what, California has the harshest because we have more movie stars, or how does it work?

JR: Well, that’s actually very insightful. California does have a very robust right of publicity. We have three separate rights of publicity in California; most states only have one. And we have rights for dead people, to protect their names and likeness and voice, even when they’re gone; and which can create a major windfall for some. And we also have rights for the living, both statute and common law, very broad; rights for the dead last 70 years after their death. Other states just incorporate this into state privacy laws and are more modest. Some states, like Utah, limit it to instances in which there’s confusion as to whether a particular person sponsored the use or endorsed the use. So there’s great variability. And I actually started a website where you can click on your state and find out the laws of the state, because they vary so dramatically. It’s Rothman’s Roadmap to the Right of Publicity, RightofPublicityRoadMap.com, and I also have breaking news there.

RS: I just want to connect this a little bit with the European Union Google issue, which has bothered a lot of people; the European Union said you have the right to control your image on the internet to some degree, and if you feel something is inaccurate–does that apply here?

JR: So they overlap. I think you’re referring to the right to be forgotten.

RS: Yes.

JR: And there’s some reasons why we might be sympathetic to that; particularly young people making bad decisions, and then all of a sudden photos of them getting into trouble are all over the internet, and it’s very difficult for people to start over or get jobs. And so the EU, as a matter of personal right, is protecting this right to be forgotten. We do not have that in the United States, and it’s very much intention with our commitments to free speech and the First Amendment. So the right of publicity in some respects is our version, but it’s not about being forgotten, or hiding history; it’s about controlling information about yourself.

RS: But it has a similar impact. And I just want to–let’s say, OK, myself; OK, let’s say I gave some dumb speech, and I don’t really want people to read it, or I wrote something or said something. I could then copyright it, right, in effect. Or my heirs and I could say in perpetuity, I don’t want this thing referenced.

JR: There’s a difference between copyright and the right of publicity. So copyright is about works of expression that are in a fixed form. So if you write a book, if you give a speech that you’ve written out, or if it’s recorded, that would also benefit from copyright. But copyright has very broad fair use provisions that allow–especially if someone’s not trying to take all the market value or sell it, is just trying to refer to it and document excerpts of it to say what you said, or to comment on your speech–copyright is going to have broad protection for that.

RS: So let me just take Martin Luther King’s, because this has been one area people are trying to, some people mistakenly, I think, trying to protect his image, where in fact they’ve actually excluded our use of his product. And I’m thinking of one particular speech, he gave a very strong speech at Riverside Church condemning the Vietnam War. And I’ve tried to run that speech on our site and elsewhere, and you really run afoul of, I guess it’s his trust, or his heirs. And they can say, we don’t want, we have to give you permission to have his speech. Is it only his voice? Can they control the text?

JR: Yeah, so the estate is very, the Martin Luther King, Jr. estate is very litigious. And they have tried to stop people from sharing his speeches, both the written text of his speeches and video clips of his speeches, and have been fairly successful. Movies and television shows have been paying the estate for permission to use his words, to show clips. And part of that is about copyright; the copyrights to the speeches and some of the video images, if they have control. The other part is the right of publicity, and they’re claiming they have a right to decide when his name and likeness and voice are used. And the U.S. government actually paid $800,000 for the statue honoring Martin Luther King in D.C., which is sort of shocking, because it seems like it’s in the public domain to honor him. The estate has also shut down the sale of Martin Luther King busts, or the sculptures that people could buy to honor him in their house, and to celebrate civil rights, and the estate said no, you don’t have the right to do that, and have been successful at stopping those uses. I don’t know if you watched the Super Bowl, but before the Super Bowl there was a Dodge commercial for a truck that used an excerpt of a Martin Luther King speech, and they did get permission from the estate, but people were outraged, because it seemed offensive to the memory of Martin Luther King, Jr. And his own daughter disclaimed, and the Coretta Scott King Foundation disclaimed their involvement in authorizing that.

RS: OK, but take us through this, because I think most people listening to this would not understand that the U.S. government could not commission an artist to do a sculpture of Martin Luther King, right, that’s going to be out in the public; they have to have the permission of his estate?

JR: Well, that is a gray area. And the U.S. government decided they didn’t want to fight with the estate or risk a lawsuit, and so they paid a large sum of money.

RS: On what basis? I mean, why can’t any artist in the world conjure up an image of Martin Luther King and make a sculpture or a painting or something? Why can’t they do that?

JR: Yes, I think it’s absurd, and somewhat gutless, by the government to be afraid and feel like they had to pay. But these are the sorts of uses, in single works of art or statues, that generally have been allowed. But on its own terms, the right of publicity, and the one that is involved with Martin Luther King, he–they’re now right after he’s dead, that his heirs have, and they can prevent uses of his name, likeness, and voice, unless either the state law has an exception, or you litigate and the First Amendment is held to protect the use. And I think in this instance, the freedom of speech would have protected the use; single statue honoring him and a short quote from one of his speeches would have also been allowed under copyright law.

RS: OK. So let’s make a, have an unflattering reference. Let’s say we have a, not a wonderful human being like Martin Luther King, we had, say, an American demagogue who was, you know, anti-Semitic and racist and homophobic and misogynist, OK, and was a senator, say, from South Carolina or something. And print their speech because it reflects all that. Isn’t there a free press, free speech right to do that without having the permission of the heirs?

JR: Yes. So I want to highlight again the difference between copyright and the right of publicity. So copyright would protect the speech, and then if you’re using an excerpt of the speech, that’s going to be a fair use, it’s going to be allowed. The right of publicity is just focused on the name and the likeness and voice. So again, if you’re referring accurately to someone, those are the sorts of uses in journalism and commentary that courts have allowed. Where it starts to get more problematic tends to be in cases where there is deemed to be some sort of commercial profiting. And sometimes the commercial profiting is in video games or in movies, which are making a profit. Or sometimes it’s in merchandise. So the Martin Luther King busts were sold for money, although part of it was donated. You can think of, there’s an artist Rick Rush who painted pictures of athletes, and notably painted a picture of Tiger Woods winning the Masters, and then he sold copies of his lithographs referring to Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods sued for a right of publicity violation, as well as some trademark violations. There the court said that the use was protected by the First Amendment in this artistic work. But we have cases that have come out another way, very similar cases in other states. For example, in California the estate of the Three Stooges sued over an artist’s rendition of a portrait of the Three Stooges, a realistic charcoal lithograph which was sold both in print, but also sold on T-shirts. And the California Supreme Court said the First Amendment didn’t protect this artistic use because they were profiting, the artist was profiting financially from the sale of the Three Stooges.

RS: So what if the T-shirt had attacked the Three Stooges and said, you know, they’re reprehensible and their comedy sucked, and then we got a picture of them, you show them being foolish, and then you had some text–that would probably be First Amendment protected, right?

JR: I think that instance, where there’s critical commentary, likely would have come out the other way and been allowed. And that’s something I talk about in the book, because the California Supreme Court contrasted this artist Gary Saderup’s painting of the Three Stooges with works by Andy Warhol. And of course Andy Warhol famously painted celebrities and made a lot of money selling his pictures, but he added some color, or changed the saturation of even black and white images. And so the question is, where, how do we determine what’s allowed and what’s not? So maybe a negative comment, but would a picture of the Three Stooges where you add color or you add a few other comedians, or you seem to be making a commentary, come out the other way? And so there’s a lot of uncertainty about what’s allowed and what’s not, and people are afraid of being liable for these right of publicity claims, and that affects what works get created.

RS: The book is called “The Right of Publicity.” Now, first of all, this right, does it go back to the Magna Carta? Does it go back to the Old Testament? You know, where does this right come from? It’s just a bunch of states at different points passed laws because they were under pressure from people who wanted to preserve their image or their product, right?

JR: Yeah, so this is, this right of publicity is not a constitutional right. However, it emerges from state law in the 1800s, and like many of our laws are, started in what’s called the common law. And that is just laws that courts make, and here is based and rooted in the notion of personal autonomy and having some zone of control over your own identity. And it started in the 1800s, largely with the emergence of what were called detective cameras, the first Kodak cameras, and people were walking down the street and all of a sudden someone could take their picture. And then they’d find it on the front page of the newspaper, or they’d find it in an advertisement for flour or life insurance, and there was an outcry by–including by journalists, surprisingly–but by average citizens, journalists, and prominent figures at the time, all calling for this right to stop unwarranted publicity about oneself, and to be able to control the use of one’s name and image. And these were the very first privacy rights that were adopted in the United States, long before the broader constitutional right of privacy emerged.

RS: [omission for station break] My guest is law professor Jennifer Rothman, who is really a pioneer in a very important and controversial area of law. And the title of her book, “The Right of Publicity: Privacy Reimagined for a Public World,” published by Harvard University Press, and she’s a professor at Loyola Law School. Why are you passionate about this? Why is this important?

JR: There are three things that drove me to write about this. And one is that I think this is an era in which so much of our information is out in public, and can really destroy people’s lives; and privacy law is not helping, particularly average citizens. Meanwhile, this right of publicity is giving a profound boost and control to very prominent public figures in ways that are shutting down free speech. And that seems to me to be exactly backwards; that the people who most need to have more leverage to control how their identity is being used have the least control, in the way we’re currently understanding the laws, while those who we need to speak about the most are able to shut down speech about themselves.

RS: Why can a well-known person control their image and an ordinary person doesn’t? Is it a matter of resources, or being able to go into court, or setting up a trust, or–?

JR: Well, it has happened because of how the law has been misunderstood. And that’s part of the mission of the book, is to talk about how this right of publicity is really one and the same as the original right of privacy, which is more focused on protecting individual rights than just economic rights.

RS: This is the thing I did not understand on our panel, and I did not get clearly from working my way through your book, which is a very good book, but it deals a lot with complex legal issues, though there are a lot of really good examples there. But take me through that. That’s the part I missed. That you really are an advocate for privacy for ordinary people, and you think this law should properly be used to extend that.

JR: Yes. And so what happened was that the right of privacy and the right of publicity turned into this intellectual property right, like copyrights or patents. And what that has done is given a very robust ownership right by people who are deemed to have commercially valuable rights of publicity–so those are usually the public figures, the celebrities. And so they’re deemed to be more valuable than others. And there was a court case involving “The Hurt Locker,” the Academy Award-winning movie, and the army sergeant who thought the movie was based on him sued, saying they’d used his identity. And he lost his lawsuit, which I think was the correct outcome in that instance. But the court said it would be different if he had a commercially valuable personality; if he earned money sort of selling his identity, the way actors and celebrities do. And so unsurprisingly, we then had Olivia de Havilland, a two-time Academy Award-winning actress, you know, understand that to be a signal that she could sue if someone used her identity in a similar biographical picture. And that’s exactly what she did, arising out of the miniseries Feud. And so that seems to me exactly backwards; that we would shut down speech about these people who aren’t replaceable; we need to refer to Olivia de Havilland if we’re telling a story about Olivia de Havilland. The other problem with the shift to the intellectual property framework–and this is another thing that people don’t realize, and that I think is quite dangerous, and drove me to write the book–is that by making it an intellectual property right, it can be taken away from people. Which, it may be problematic if someone takes your car; if you declare bankruptcy and you lose your car. But it’s even more chilling if you declare bankruptcy and you lose the right to your own name and voice and likeness. And that’s what can happen when we understand the right of publicity as we often do today, as this transferable, intellectual property right.

RS: Let me ask you, there’s one case that comes up, I think that involved a UCLA basketball player who showed up in a video game, his likeness. And there’s a lot of college athletes have been used in that way, and they don’t get money from this thing, so they sued. And I think successfully stopped it, is that correct?

JR: Yes. So there were a series of lawsuits by athletes, student athletes and professional athletes, about the uses of their identities. And there were a number involving video games. And so the video games recreated historical rosters’ players, and they licensed the NCAA, and the NCAA made a lot of money about this. But it also raises some of the free speech issues, because you’re describing actual players who played on actual teams, and statistics, very much like fantasy sports. And that the Supreme Court recently gave sort of a broader license to be able to do by legalizing sports gambling. And so the question is, how much control do athletes have over these uses of their identity? And the, in the video game cases, several federal appellate courts said the First Amendment doesn’t protect those uses, and that the athletes have to be paid. Now, as a matter of First Amendment law, I think that’s wrong, and very troubling. Because it’s shutting down speech about real people, and accurate descriptions of history; you can imagine that it would really limit biographical video games. On the other hand, student athletes, I think, are greatly mistreated by the NCAA. And actually until recently the NCAA had the students sign contracts, as a condition for playing and for getting their scholarship money, that transferred their rights of publicity–their rights to their names, likeness, and voice–in perpetuity, forever, to the NCAA. And so that’s very much in the heartland of what’s concerning to me, that these student athletes who have no leverage would be forced to sign their rights of publicity to the NCAA. And then of course if the NCAA owned the rights, they could not only license the student athletes in video games, but they could have them appear in advertisements or all sorts of products without further permission from the athletes, for the rest of the athletes’ lives, and even after death, under many of these laws.

RS: So what’s the current status of that? Can you grab an athlete’s image and exploit it? The NCAA is particularly offensive in that way.

JR: It depends on the context. So in video games, it seems not; that you need to get permission, at least depending on the type of video game, from the athletes. But there are other cases involving the use of photographs that the NCAA took of the students while they were playing, and courts have allowed those photographs to be sold by the NCAA without additional permission or payment to the student athletes.

RS: “The Right of Publicity: Privacy Reimagined for a Public World.” And it could just as easily say, “Privacy reimagined in the age of the internet.” Wouldn’t that be also? I mean, the public world is really this internet that we are living in now. And do you think it’s hopeless–or, obviously, you don’t; you wrote this whole book–can we really have sensible rules of the road for the internet in this regard?

JR: Yes, I think that the right of publicity is one of the opportunities for preserving the concept, the broader idea of privacy, and what we really want in the internet age. So it used to be that you would write a letter and no one would see it, and now, you might write a blog post or share images on Instagram, and if you ask–sometimes people say, particularly older people looking at the younger generation, will say “Young people don’t care at all today about privacy.” And when you dig down a little deeper and ask the younger people about what their preferences are, they actually care a great deal about privacy. What they don’t care as much about is secrecy. But they care very much about control. So they might want to share where they’re eating or what they’re eating or who they were with or their blog post, but they want to be able to control what else is done with it. So by putting it out on the internet, they’re not saying, here, take this and do what you want with it. They’re sharing it, but also want to control its future use. So they would be as upset as anyone else if it then got used, say, in an advertisement, or if Facebook coopted it and started disseminating it. Twitter has started selling playing cards with Twitter users on it, and didn’t get additional permission. Those are the sorts of uses, even if someone puts an image out there on the internet, that they want to be able to control. It’s often said that privacy is dead, but that’s only by people who really don’t understand what the original concept of privacy was.

RS: Right, but you’ve put your finger on the main contradiction, which I find–I don’t know about your students, but I find my students at USC, that this is it. They’ll at first say, who cares, so Yelp knows where I ate, and so Facebook has this. And then, if any of them in the room have experienced the misuse of that information–they’ve been stalked, they’ve been defamed, their pictures have been distorted, their private information–suddenly, they’re very much for controlling it. And it really even goes to political expression–well, very much so. If you don’t think you’re going to do anything that disturbs the government, or disturbs powerful people, then you say who cares if you know what I read or what movies I watch or my letters. But if you think you might say something controversial, then there’s a different sense. And I think Mark Zuckerberg’s idea, really, was that we would be a passive nation of consumers. And in the interest of more effectively consuming, we would reveal everything about ourselves–our clothing sizes, our tastes–right? So we would get product placement near us. And I think we now have had a moment, a time of reckoning, that no–this could really hurt you. Do you get a sense of a shift in attitudes in response to your book?

JR: I think that there’s growing awareness. And certainly the Cambridge Analytica coverage made people more aware of how their information is being used in ways that they were not aware of, and that they don’t agree with. And the right of publicity is one way to try to push back on that by giving people a lever of control. It’s not the only way, and I think that there needs to be probably some government regulation in this space as well, particularly related to online privacy. But the right of publicity starts by giving people a baseline of control over their name, likeness, and voice, and some other aspects of identity. And I think it’s something that everyone needs to be very aware of in the digital age. Because not only does it have this opportunity, but it has these risks. So when you repost things, you could potentially be liable for violating someone else’s right of publicity, and you might unwittingly assign your right of publicity to someone else, whether it’s Facebook in terms of service that you haven’t read, if they decide to be more expansive, or if you’re an aspiring actor or model or singer or athlete, in your contract. So it’s something that people really need to be attuned to. And as I said, when people repost things, they may potentially open themselves up to liability. For example, if they’re using celebrities to mash up new videos, they may be liable for a right of publicity violation. Reese Witherspoon has sued over repostings of her Instagram and Twitter, I believe, from jewelers and fashion companies that reposted images of her wearing their products or using their products. So you can imagine individuals doing that as well.

RS: Right now all we have is opt out. If you know something is being misused in some data, you can make a complaint and try to get it withdrawn, and so forth. The onus is on you to discover it, to be aggressive about getting it changed, and so forth. If we had a rule, and this was proposed early on in the age of the internet, of opt in, that before they can use your data for a purpose different than what you intended–in other words, I’m going to pick a restaurant tonight, and that’s all my reason, is I’m giving you information to pick that restaurant, and what I order even, or what have you. I don’t want that shared with someone else who’s marketing this, or exploiting this, and so forth. Why can’t we just have a simple opt-in rule, that before they can use your data for some other purpose, they have to have your permission?

JR: I think that opt in is crucial to preserving privacy in this country and in the internet world. It just hasn’t happened yet as the default. But I think that the opt out will not work. And what we mean by this is that the default should be that your privacy and your information is protected, and if you want to give it up, if you want them to share it, you’re affirmatively giving that permission in every instance in an informed way, rather than just in a blanket, click-through license that no one reads. And I think that’s essential. The right of publicity is just one step in that, by having the default be that people have some control over that identifying information about themselves. Now, some of it is anonymized, and then we need other controls. And the government, of course, can establish a requirement of opt in, that information about people is only revealed when they are specifically asked and informed in every instance, and give permission. But they haven’t done that yet.

RS: The whole question of can you get legislation that protects the individual. And I remember when we had the Financial Services Modernization Act, the thing that allowed commercial and investment banks to get together and merge their activities, and we even had insurance companies forming with banks–all this data was suddenly available, and this was in the late 1990s. Interesting coalition of conservatives like William Safire, who had been Nixon’s speechwriter, was a New York Times columnist; Ed Markey, who’s now a senator from Massachusetts; you could find a whole number of these people, said no, we have to have opt in. If you don’t have opt in, you have no protection. And so it isn’t that this is, oh, maybe we should do it–no, there are active lobbying groups, and the people who want to commercially exploit our private data are the people who always say, no, you can’t do this. And they win, because they have campaign money they can throw at it. So isn’t it really that the solution here that’s available to us is one that we’re not even discussing, let alone implementing? That you should be able to control how the data you offer up, say on Facebook, is used?

JR: Yes, I think that there are multiple things that have to happen. So one is that this right of publicity can be wielded more, and we’re starting to see more lawsuits and pushback in that regard. Second, you’re right, the legislation may be an uphill battle given the various lobbyists. But there may be some market opportunities here for competitors to offer more privacy protected options, and that’s true in other spaces. In the internet, for example, there are search engines that are more protective of privacy than others, and they’re currently free. But it’s also true that people have been sort of lured into giving up their privacy by having these free services, and people need to be willing to pay for privacy. There may be a space where we need to educate people, but we also may need some people who are willing to provide free services that are more privacy protected, maybe nonprofit models.

Tammy Duckworth visited female activists in a Capitol Hill Senate building who are protesting the administration's "zero-tolerance" immigration policy

"I wanted to show my support for the folks here today," Duckworth, who gave birth to her second child in April, told CNN in an interview after she visited with protesters. "I could only imagine what it would be like to have my daughter -- my breastfeeding child -- ripped away from me the way some of these other moms' babies have been."

More than 1,000 female activists marched through Washington Thursday to protest the separation of children from their immigration parents at the US-Mexico border.

US Capitol Police arrested approximately 575 individuals with unlawfully demonstrating, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington.

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren once encouraged her home state to house unaccompanied immigrant children on military bases in 2014, but she decries the Trump administration’s use of detention centers.

During the surge of children crossing the southern border illegally in 2014 and 2015, Warren and fellow Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey endorsed former Gov. Duval Patrick’s offer to house the unaccompanied minors at military bases.

“These kids are at real risk and we need to do everything we can to make sure they are not harmed or in danger,” Warren said in 2014, according to MassLive. “I agree with Pope Francis that this is a humanitarian crisis, and I believe every state that can help, should help.”

The Obama administration eventually housed several thousand migrants at military bases across the country in 2014, The Washington Post reported, but Massachusetts military installations were not needed during that crisis. The administration further considered Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts to house migrants in 2016. (RELATED: Migrant Children Released To Sponsors Without Background Checks Under Obama)

In a letter to President Donald Trump on June 13, Warren and 39 other senators urged the administration to end the practice of separating families who crossed the border illegally, noting that it could lead to sending children to military bases.

“We are writing to ask that you reverse course on your inhumane decision to separate children from their parents at the border,” Warren and other senators wrote in the letter to Trump, before he announced his plan to house immigrant families together at military bases. “This policy has traumatized children who are fleeing extreme violence. Our government has a humanitarian duty to the children and families seeking asylum in the United States to end this policy immediately.”

The senators wrote that removing children should be done if the child was in danger, and warned that doing so might lead to housing immigrants on military bases.

“Best practices in child welfare promote keeping children and their parents together unless removal is in the child’s best interest,” the letter said. “Unnecessarily separating more children from their parents will further exacerbate the lack of home-based foster care placements available and increase the use of large-capacity institutional settings, such as abandoned military bases, to house these children.”

The Keeping Families Together Act, proposed legislation from Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and cosponsored by Warren on June 13, states that “in general, there is a presumption that detention is not in the best interests of families and children.” In their letter, the senators argued that the “community-based alternatives to detention, like intensive case management and referrals to social services and legal resources” have been proven to “increase the likelihood that immigrants appear at court proceedings.”

Warren visited the Central Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, Saturday, to inspect the conditions of children held there. The center was opened during the 2014 minor surge, and is run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

In an emotional press gaggle outside the center, Warren described seeing the children sleeping on floors at the center in cages.

“And they’re all on the concrete floors in cages. There’s just no other way to describe it. They’re big, chain-link cages on cold concrete floors and metal blankets handed out to the people,” Warren said. “The question we asked many of them … Were they glad they cam?. And for all of them it brought smiles. And they said, ‘Yes, I am here in America.'”

“It’s a disturbing picture,” Warren said.

The Pentagon announced Sunday that it is considering two military bases for temporary housing of migrant families. Warren’s office did not immediately return The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

So Warner may not have been joking when, according to Politico, he made a joke about the Mueller probe at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event on Martha’s Vineyard over the weekend.

“If you get me one more glass of wine, I’ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know,” Warner reportedly told the 100 or so guests. “If you think you’ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up. It’s going to be a wild couple of months.”

The Vineyard, which served as the summer White House during BarackObama’s administration, remains a popular destination for glad-handing lawmakers looking to raise money or just relax. Politico reports that Warner and attorney/businesswoman Connie Milstein hosted a party at Milstein’s Edgartown house that drew Democratic Senators Chris Coons, Michael Bennet, Sheldon Whitehouse, Doug Jones, Gary Peters, Chris Van Hollen, and Massachusetts’ own Ed Markey.ARTICLE:Lawmakers demand secret VA nursing home data be released after reportNick Bonanno pushed his father, Russ Bonanno, down the hallway at the VA in Bedford.

WASHINGTON — Several members of Congress demanded Tuesday that the Department of Veterans Affairs release a full complement of nursing home data that the agency has kept hidden from the public for years, citing a recent USA Today and Boston Globe investigation into the state of care at VA facilities.

The VA pushed back Tuesday on the report, which was based on the agency’s own internal documents and facility ratings, by downplaying the findings and calling the story “fake news.”

Documents show that care at the VA’s 133 nursing homes scored worse on average than private-sector nursing homes on key quality indicators, including rates of antipsychotic drug prescription and residents’ deterioration.

Following inquiries from USA Today and the Globe, the VA last week released some of its nursing home ratings, but not the underlying quality data, such as rates of infection and injury. The agency has tracked this information for years but kept it from public view.

Several Democratic lawmakers — including Massachusetts Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, as well as US Representative Seth Moulton — called for the information to be released immediately.

“Widespread underperformance at VA nursing homes is a betrayal of veterans’ trust and wellbeing,” said Minnesota Representative Tim Walz, the highest ranking Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. “VA concealing this data from the public until news stories were about to be filed makes matters infinitely worse and is nothing more than fake transparency.”

Both the Republican-led House and Senate VA committees requested briefings from VA officials following the report. Those meetings are scheduled later this week, spokespeople for the committees said.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour, meanwhile, took to Twitter to claim that prior to President Trump’s administration, “you haven’t seen this much VA transparency or accountability” and called the story about the secret nursing home data “the definition of fake news.”

Cashour on Tuesday claimed the story painted “a misleading picture of how our facilities actually compare with the private sector.”

The ratings showed that as of March 31, nearly half of VA nursing homes — 58 — received the lowest rating for quality in the agency’s rankings of one out of five stars.

He declined to answer questions about why the VA hasn’t released the nursing home quality data, inspection reports, or staffing data.

Cashour asserted that “overall,” the VA nursing home system “compares closely” with the private sector. But he said VA nursing homes score lower on key quality indicators because veterans are typically sicker than residents of private facilities.

“Also, private sector nursing homes admit patients selectively, whereas — unlike the private sector — VA will not refuse service to any eligible veteran, no matter how challenging the veteran’s conditions are to treat,” Cashour said.

Moulton, an Iraq War veteran who receives health care at the Bedford, Mass., VA, said he has been pushing Republican leadership to conduct a field hearing at his facility. “It’s past time for more accountability for our vets,” he said.

“Veterans deserve the best health care in the world. Period. That means having more transparency than private providers, not less,” Moulton said. “The VA is doing many things well, but this is a clear example of where they are failing.”

The VA nursing home in Bedford was one of the worst in the country in the agency’s quality ratings last year, receiving one out of five stars, in part for giving so many residents

antipsychotic drugs, according to internal VA documents.

Markey criticized the VA for “not proactively communicating comprehensive information to the public” and asked VA officials for a briefing as soon as possible.

“Men, women and families who have sacrificed for our country deserve access to timely, quality information to provide a full picture of care, similar to what private nursing home facilities have made available for years,” Markey wrote Tuesday in a three-page letter to VA executive in charge Dr. Carolyn Clancy.

In an e-mail to Bedford VA employees sent Monday, director Joan Clifford wrote: “We are enormously proud of the work we have done and continue to do in addressing improvement opportunities. We thank you, as always, for your commitment and dedication to ensuring that Bedford VA continues to be a safe, supportive and caring place for all who come to us.”

The nursing home, she wrote, has reduced the use of drugs, reduced the incidence of pressure ulcers, and provided a restraint-free environment.

The VA nursing home in Tuskegee, Ala., also was among the worst in the country in the agency’s quality ratings last year, according to internal documents. Staff there lost track of Earl James Zook, 72, a dementia patient and known wander risk, who walked out a broken door on a secure ward in January 2017 and hasn’t been seen since.

“This information is shocking,” Alabama Senator Doug Jones said.

A bipartisan group of House members from Florida penned a letter to the VA Monday urging that care be improved at VA nursing homes in Tampa and Bay Pines, Fla., both one-star facilities in agency rankings. The lawmakers called the VA’s claim that veterans are sicker than private nursing home residents “simply insufficient.”

“We cannot tolerate sub-par quality of care for Veterans who have sacrificed so much,” wrote Republican Representative Gus Bilirakis and Democratic Representatives Kathy Castor and Charlie Crist.

Cashour, the VA spokesman, said the “VA appreciates the lawmakers’ concerns and will respond to them directly.”

Conservative advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, which has generally been supportive of VA leadership under Trump, echoed lawmakers who said VA needs to open the books on its nursing homes.

“The more data that the VA can share, the better, because ultimately, at the end of the day, it helps veterans,” Dan Caldwell, executive director of the group, said in an interview. “It helps veterans determine whether or not they are getting the quality of care that they deserve.”

Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert Kennedy, plans to participate in a hunger strike in protest of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy for immigrants who enter the country illegally, in conjunction with several activist groups and nearly 50 other members of the Kennedy family.

The fast, which started Saturday, is scheduled to last for 24 days, in honor of the estimated 2,400 children that have been separated from their parents. Organizers ask that each participant fast for 24 hours and make a donation in place of the food they would have eaten to Break Bread Not Families, said Kerry Kennedy, head of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group.

“We want to find a way for people who can’t go down to the border to actually do something themselves at home that is concrete and creates change, and this is what we’re calling on them to do,” Kerry Kennedy, also the daughter of Ethel and Robert, told the Globe.

Ethel Kennedy, who did not travel to the border, has not yet begun her fast, though she’s “very joyful about it,” her daughter said.

The administration’s zero-tolerance policy for families that enter illegally along the Southwest border, which began in April, has led to thousands of children being separated from their parents, officials estimated.

In recent weeks, pictures and audio of crying children surrounded by metal fences in detention centers have gone viral online, triggering wide outrage from officials, public figures, and members of the general public.

Last week, Trump signed an executive order aimed at keeping immigrant families together, while continuing the zero-tolerance policy.

In a statement, Ethel Kennedy said Trump’s order was “not a time to declare victory and go home.

“Generations of Americans did not toil and sacrifice to build a country where children and their parents are placed in cages to advance a cynical political agenda,” the statement said.

Massachusetts Representative Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert and Ethel, is also participating in the fast.

“For children being starved of contact with their parents, the irreparable harm inflicted by our government multiplies every single day kids remain separated from their moms and dads,” he said in a statement. “Through the Break Bread Not Families Fast, we hope to underscore the urgency our nation faces to confront this moral crisis perpetuated within our shores.”

Kerry Kennedy traveled to McAllen and spoke to people who were at risk of being deported and separated from their children, she said.

“Why are we doing that as a country?” Kennedy said about the policies. “Where is our compassion? Where is our love, and our values, and our quest for justice? How is that just?”

RFK Human Rights, which Ethel Kennedy founded, organized the hunger fast along with La Unión Del Pueblo Entero, the Texas Civil Rights Project, and Neta.

“This is not only immoral, it is also illegal under U.S. and international law,” RFK Human Rights wrote in a statement announcing the protest.

The movement caught the attention of several high-profile celebrities who signed on to participate in the hunger strike, including Alec Baldwin, Alfre Woodard, Keegan-Michael Key, and Evan Rachel Wood, Kennedy said.

Fasting is a form of non violent protest and I was happy to be a part of their ceremony in Texas this morning and carry the strike another 24 hours before it is passed to the next person. https://t.co/pMDC8LUaEB — #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) June 25, 2018

Both senators from Massachusetts, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, also plan to fast for 24 hours, she said.

Follow him on Twitter @jdcapeloutoARTICLE:Democrats flood border, demanding answers on immigrant child separationsWASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats are flocking to the border, investigating conditions in immigrant detention centers and denouncing President Trump.

Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representatives Katherine Clark and Mike Capuano of Massachusetts were among the more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers who traveled to the Southern border this weekend in a blue wave of outrage.

But they were unable to extract many answers from front-line US Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, who are awaiting directions from Washington on how to accomplish the daunting task of reuniting the thousands of children the government separated from their parents as part of a “zero tolerance” policy on the border. They also gave little information on where families and children would be held together under Trump’s revised policy — and for how long.

“Every question I asked seemed to have a complicated answer that led to two more questions,” Warren told the Globe in a phone interview Sunday.

Even though Trump reversed his policy of forced family separations and says he is now planning to detain families together, Democrats are keeping up intense pressure on Trump and his Republican allies over a volatile issue that has become a political crisis for the GOP heading into the mid-term congressional elections.

Polls show that Trump’s devoted base is sticking with him and supports his decision to criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the border. But the Trump administration’s handling of the mass detentions and the resulting chaos are energizing the opposition and risk weakening support for the GOP from independents and suburban Republicans.

The Department of Homeland Security released a fact sheet Saturday claiming it had reunited 523 children with their parents so far, and had a “well coordinated” plan for how to reunite the remaining 2,053 children who have been distributed across the country to far-flung shelters and foster homes while their parents were deported or held in detention centers on the border. DHS added that it is working to “ensure communication” between parents and their children.

Tearful mothers in one detention center, however, told lawmakers they hadn’t spoken to their children and didn’t know where they were being held.

“We met with dozens of moms who don’t know where their children are, have not been allowed to contact them, and are simply heartbroken and grief-stricken that they haven’t been able to find their children,” Clark told the Globe by phone on Saturday.

On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order ending his policy of separating parents and their children for now, asking the courts for permission to hold them together indefinitely while they await their immigration court dates. Children and parents appeared to no longer be separated at a Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas, according to Clark and Warren. Children were kept with their parents in the caged-off areas, rather than being held separately and then transferred to shelters.

Warren said she was told by Border Patrol agents while touring the facility that under the new plan, men with children were for the most part being released to relatives in the United States to await their court dates. Women with children were more likely to remain detained in an ICE facility. The agents told her this was for the women’s safety, and because of a lack of detention space for adult men with children. Warren was also told that aunts, uncles, grandparents, or adult siblings traveling with minor relatives will still be separated from them under the new policy.

“This processing center is a tough thing to see,” Warren said. “I’ve just seen thousands of people held in cages.”

When lawmakers met with about 25 mothers later Saturday at the Port Isabel Detention Center, they were told the Trump administration has a long way to go before reuniting parents with the children who were taken from them.

“The reunification seems to be totally rudderless and without a strategy or a plan on how they’re going to put these families back together,” Clark said.

“A lot of people are not being told what’s happening to their children,” Capuano said.

Some parents complained they were being charged for phone calls, which made it harder for them to locate their children, according to Clark and Capuano. An ICE spokeswoman, Sarah Rodriguez, said in a statement that ICE detainees are able to call their children free of charge, once ICE has coordinated the call with HHS. The agency has not disclosed what percent of separated parents have been able to talk to their children.

Sleepy border towns have been transformed into hot spots for Democrats in the past few weeks, and the visits do not appear to be slowing. While Clark and Capuano were in McAllen, another group of lawmakers, including Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who is running to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, visited Tornillo, near El Paso, to inspect the “tent city” built for children there. On Thursday, a group of 19 mayors traveled to Tornillo as well, including Mayor Bill DeBlasio of New York and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a rumored Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. On Friday, Senator Kamala Harris of California, another potential 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, toured a detention center in her state. And 12 members of Congress plan to fast for a day to show solidarity with the separated children, including Massachusetts lawmakers Senator Ed Markey and Representatives Joe Kennedy and Clark.

The president has accused Democrats of seizing on his separation of thousands of children from their parents, which has been widely denounced as inhumane, for their own political gain. But the president also boasted that cracking down on immigrants was a political winner for Republicans. “They want to use the issue,” Trump said of Democrats at a rally in Nevada Saturday night. “I like the issue for our election, too.”

A Republican senator accused the Trump administration of taking drastic action on immigration in order to motivate its base before the midterms.

“The administration obviously made a very large mistake,” Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” Sunday. “I know that some in the White House want to use the immigration issue as a force to activate the base for elections.”

But a recent CBS News poll suggests that the issue is more favorable politically for Democrats than Republicans. Seventy-two percent of Americans disapprove of separating parents from their children at the border, including about half of Republicans. Eighty-four percent of Democrats and 55 percent of independents claim the issue will be a factor in their vote in the 2018 midterms, with just 43 percent of Republicans saying the same.

Clark said Democratic members of Congress have been inundated with calls from constituents who are fired up about stopping the separations. Her trip, organized by the Democratic Women’s Working Group, expanded to include male members because of the intense demand.

“All of us have received so many phone calls, so many e-mails from our constituents, and it’s so frustrating and frightening, the stories that were coming out of the border, that I’m not surprised that members wanted to come and bear witness to this and get answers to their questions,” she said.

Misha Carlson spent much of her young life overseas, the child of parents engaged in international development. Though she was interested in politics, she didn’t plan to become directly involved — not, at least, until Donald Trump was elected.

“My freshman year of college, everything I thought I knew kind of came tumbling down,” said the rising Tufts University junior.

So she applied for a summer internship in the Cambridge office of US Representative Katherine Clark. She had plenty of competition.

Most members of the state’s solidly Democratic congressional delegation have seen a surge in the number of prospective interns as the Trump administration moves through its second year of governance.

Clark’s office, for instance, received eight applications for eight spots last year. This year, staffers saw an “exponential uptick” — 50 students applied. Carlson was one of the lucky ones and secured a spot.

Likewise, the offices of Representatives Joe Kennedy III, Seth Moulton, Jim McGovern, and Bill Keating all reported more applications, as did Senator Elizabeth Warren’s staff. A spokeswoman for Senator Ed Markey said his office has fielded “double if not triple” the typical number of applications each semester since the 2016 election.

Lauren Amendolara McDermott, a spokeswoman for Keating, said the students cited school shootings, the United States pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and “the changing foreign perspective of the United States” as some of the issues that drove them to apply.

Giselle Barry, Markey’s communications director, told the Globe that “in many of the interviews with prospective interns, they often cite frustration with the Trump administration as the reason for wanting to intern, giving them a chance to ‘do something.’ ”

It’s no surprise. A March survey by the Pew Research Center found that the president’s approval rating is lower among millennials than Generation X’ers or baby boomers. About two-thirds of millennials, 65 percent, gave Trump a thumbs-down, compared with 57 percent of Gen X’ers and 51 percent of boomers. In fact, one intern for Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire was suspended for a week after registering her displeasure with Trump by yelling an expletive at him as he walked through the Capitol last month.

These young people, part of a generation formerly considered largely unengaged politically, appear primed for action.

The Harvard Public Opinion Project, which has been analyzing the political tendencies and civic engagement of young Americans since 2000, reported in April that youth participation in the political process is on target for a dramatic rise: 51 percent of people ages 18 to 29 who identify as Democrats said they will “definitely” vote in the upcoming midterm elections. That was up from 28 percent during the run-up to the 2014 midterm elections.

According to the poll, 64 percent in the age group were “fearful” for the future of American democracy, while 34 percent said they were “hopeful.”

Another Tufts student, rising senior Robert Toscano, is studying international relations with a focus on Middle Eastern studies. But after a semester abroad in Jordan, he decided he needed to get involved in domestic politics.

“A lot of people in international relations had a wake-up call,” said Toscano, who just completed an internship with the state Democratic Party. “Recent decisions by this administration have made me realize they’re going to have long-lasting effects on America’s place in the world. I want to help elect the people who have a similar worldview as I do.”

While more students are seeking direct involvement with elective politics, some are pursuing other ways to get involved. Carlson has a friend who’s doing a summer internship in economic research, and another who’s working for an environmental agency.

As a pollster in training, Harvard student Teddy Landis is taught to be “100 percent nonpartisan.” Under polling director John Della Volpe, Landis served as chair of the latest HPOP poll, a project of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School.

Landis will spend the summer in Washington, on an internship at Civic Nation, a nonprofit that oversees a cluster of public awareness campaigns “to address some of our nation’s most pressing challenges,” according to its website, including immigration, sexual misconduct, and racism.

“I’m looking right now to explore politics from as many angles as I possibly can,” said Landis, who will be working with the organization’s #VoteTogether campaign. “I’m going to be graduating in an election year, in 2020. One cool possibility would be the opportunity to work on a presidential campaign.”

Though the New York native is committed to weighing both sides, many of his peers seem inclined to lean left. (According to the HPOP poll, 69 percent of voting-age young people would prefer Democratic control of Congress, a number that has been on the rise.) Landis said he has been inspired by young people’s involvement in movements such as gun control and the Women’s March.

Such responses to the policies of the current administration are good news for those working to increase voter turnout.

At Boston Calling in May, Kim Selig worked with a team of volunteers at a booth for HeadCount, a grass-roots voter-registration effort that partners with musicians to connect with young people. The 2017 Temple University graduate said the group’s registration drives have been more successful than ever.

“We’re blowing our numbers out of the water,” Selig said. HeadCount registered 5,000 new voters at March for Our Lives events in March around the country. At the Hangout Festival on the beach in Gulf Shores, Ala., in May, the group registered 400, doubling its total from the last midterm cycle.

Selig began volunteering for HeadCount as a college freshman — mostly, she said with a laugh, so she could go to concerts for free. Now she works as one of the organization’s field directors. She has a theory about the apparent surge in political involvement among her age group.

“Politics seems more accessible to people now,” she said.

Selig’s group is likely to get a lift from a group of Parkland, Fla., school-shooting survivors who have embarked on a two-month tour to 50 cities in 20 states, calling for action on gun control and staging voter-registration drives with HeadCount.

Clark, the congresswoman who organized the gun control “sit-in” on the floor of the House two years ago after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, said she is particularly motivated to work on issues of importance to young voters. In a recent interview, she mentioned the opioid crisis, equal pay, access to child care, online safety, and student debt.

For young voters, however, it’s not necessarily about one party versus the other, Clark said.

“Many of them haven’t been particularly partisan, but they’re looking for people they believe are acting on issues they care about. It’s always the highest compliment when students say they appreciate my work and would love to work in my office.”

Follow him on Twitter @sullivanjamesARTICLE:Democrats, with few options to stall Trump’s Supreme Court pick, will emphasize abortion stakesSenator Elizabeth Warren told activists at the Supreme Court Thursday she would fight the president’s nominee “with every bone in my body.”

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are vowing a fight for the ages to stop President Trump’s as-yet-unnamed Supreme Court pick from getting confirmed. Senator Elizabeth Warren said Thursday that she is “prepared to fight with every bone in my body.”

But with few procedural options to block Trump’s nominee, and uncertainty about whether they can even hold their caucus together, Democrats probably will have to settle for the next best option: using their fierce battle over a likely rightward shift on the high court to motivate voters in the 2018 congressional elections.

Women, especially female swing voters in suburbs, will be the targets of a relentless campaign focused on the likelihood of greater restrictions on abortion or even an outright reversal of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that struck down abortion bans. Democrats are warning women could be “put in jail” under the reign of the future Supreme Court.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is retiring, is a moderately conservative swing justice who was pivotal in decisions enshrining gay people’s right to marry and striking down states’ attempts to limit abortion rights. His replacement could take the court sharply right on the environment, gay rights, and abortion, among other issues. Democrats think the threat could galvanize their base even more than Democratic voters’ dislike of the president.

“I didn’t think that our enthusiasm could get bigger, but a tempest is coming,” said Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut.

Carolyn Kaster/Associated Press/file 2018 “I didn’t think that our enthusiasm could get bigger, but a tempest is coming,” said Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut.

Republicans are also giddy at the prospect of facing what looks like a tough midterm election with the boost of a second Supreme Court justice under their belts.

“It’s good politics for Republicans,” said Alex Conant, a GOP political consultant who’s worked for Senator Marco Rubio. “I’d much rather have abortion be the topic this fall than Trump’s tweets.”

But Democrats think this could be a miscalculation if they are able to make the Supreme Court battle a referendum on the right to a legal abortion a few months before the election. About 70 percent of Americans oppose overturning Roe v. Wade, according to several polls from Pew and Quinnipiac. Many suburban Republicans eager to talk tax cuts and the booming economy are unlikely to benefit from a conversation about banning abortion.

While the Senate will be the focal point of the confirmation debate, Democrats have a better chance in the November elections of flipping the House from Republican control, and that is where the biggest impact could be.

“Having a national debate about overturning Roe v. Wade imperils Republicans in the suburban districts that are key to their chance of holding the House,” said Jesse Ferguson, a former staffer for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid.

The battle is shaping up to be acrimonious, with many Senate Democrats still hopping mad over Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s move to block hearings for Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick for nearly a year in 2016 because it was a presidential election year. Senator Ben Sasse said Wednesday that the once somber and bipartisan confirmation process has turned into “blood sport.”

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow told Democrats on her show Wednesday night not to be “doormats” — urging them to unify as a caucus and use whatever tools necessary to block a pick.

But Democrats have few procedural tricks available. They can refuse to show up for votes, but can be compelled to return to the Senate floor under the institution’s rules. They can slow hearings, but only for so long.

“Ain’t gonna happen,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican in Senate leadership, told reporters Thursday, referring to Democrats’ chances of blocking confirmation.

Democrats are painting the confirmation battle in apocalyptic terms, calling the prospect of an antiabortion conservative replacing Kennedy “terrifying” and raising the specter of women languishing in jails.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said “women’s lives are at risk,” with Kennedy’s departure. The New York Democrat questioned ‘‘whether we are going to be arresting women for making decisions about their bodies.’’

“So many of our fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties — and the rule of law — are all at risk,” said former vice president Joe Biden.

Maddow raised the prospect of the court allowing states to outlaw birth control, which was legalized in 1965. “What if birth control was illegal? What would you do if birth control was illegal?” she asked on her show Wednesday.

J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press Young activists demonstrated at the Supreme Court as President Trump prepared to choose a replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy, on Capitol Hill in Washington on Thursday.

All sides are planning expensive advertising and e-mail blitzes in an attempt to mobilize the grass roots.

“The impact of Justice Kennedy’s announcement is enormous and terrifying — for everything from reproductive rights to health care to voting rights and beyond,” said Julie McClain Downey, a spokeswoman for Emily’s List, a group that works to elect women who support abortion rights. “The work we are doing here is imperative because it feels like our freedom depends on our success.”

The focus on Roe could have a particularly strong impact on female voters, who have driven Democratic victories in special elections in Alabama and Virginia since Trump was elected in 2016.

“Women around this country are already galvanized, they’re mobilizing politically in a way we haven’t seen in a generation,” said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

In addition to motivating their base, Democrats are hoping that stressing the importance of the historic Roe v. Wade decision could draw a handful of moderate Republicans to their side, putting pressure on Trump to pick a justice who refers to the decision as “settled law.”

Democrats hope to woo GOP Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who are both in favor of abortion rights, to their side, robbing Trump of the majority he needs unless he picks someone who vows not to overturn Roe.

“This is a legacy vote,” Murphy said. “I don’t think you can say you are pro-choice if you cast a vote that will be looked upon as the one that criminalized abortion and put women in jail.”

But even if Collins and Murkowski were swayed by that argument, it’s unclear whether Democrats would hold together in opposition to a nominee who is evasive on the abortion question. A handful of Democratic senators up for reelection in red states are facing pressure to back the president’s pick no matter what.

Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a Democrat who faces a tough reelection bid this year, said Thursday that he would judge the pick based on his or her qualifications and dismissed the idea that Democrats could influence the pick or delay the confirmation.

“We have very little control,” Manchin said.

(AP) — Florida’s busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, including U.S. citizens, according to officials there.

The expected announcement Thursday at Orlando International Airport alarms some privacy advocates who say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don’t involve all international travelers at the airports like the program’s expansion in Orlando would. The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has images of people who should be on the flight, in order to verify the traveler’s identity.

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency “doesn’t seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out,” said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

U.S. citizens at the Orlando airport will be able to opt out just like at the other airports if they don’t want to provide their photograph, Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in an email. However, a notice about a possible rule change for the program states that “U.S. citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States.”

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” he said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year.

Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans’ accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Two U.S. senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

“It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport,” said the letter from U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.ARTICLE:Millions Lack Basic Necessities, but the Senate Just Passed a $716 Billion Bill for Endless War and EmpireARTICLE:Hundreds Arrested at Senate Office Building ProtestHundreds of protesters were arrested Thursday after staging a sit-in at a U.S. Senate office building in Washington to protest the Trump administration's immigration policy.

U.S. Capitol Police arrested 575 activists, mostly women, decrying President Donald Trump's "zero-tolerance" policy on admission of undocumented immigrants.

They chanted "What do we want? Free families!'' and "This is what democracy looks like,'' as they sat in the Hart Senate Office Building's atrium.

Protesters wrapped themselves in Mylar blankets, like the ones given to children separated from their families at the southern U.S. border and detained.

Democratic Senators Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Maizi Hirono of Hawaii and Ed Markey of Massachusetts were among those who visited the protesters to lend their support.

Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, herself an immigrant, tweeted that she was among those arrested.

Under the zero-tolerance policy, the government has begun prosecuting all migrants caught entering the country without authorization. Trump has halted his policy of taking children from their detained parents under public pressure, but an estimated 2,000 of them are still being held, with many families saying they don't know how to locate them.

Similar protests also took place elsewhere around the country. Hundreds gathered at a rally outside a federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley.

Dozens of people shut down a government meeting in Michigan to protest a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees at a local jail.

Eight others were arrested outside an ICE building in Portland, Oregon, that has been closed because of a round-the-clock demonstration.ARTICLE:Face Scans for International Travelers at Florida AirportFlorida’s busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, including U.S. citizens, according to officials there.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scan technology. But they do not require it for every passenger on international flights.

With biometric security, facial images are sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which then compares them with a photo already on file, usually from a passenger’s passport or driver’s license. The database verifies passenger identities and confirms they are meant to be on the flight, usually within three to five seconds.

Privacy advocates worry that the expanded program in Orlando will create problems due to the lack of regulation. There are no formal rules about what happens to the data collected, nor what actions should be taken if a passenger is wrongly blocked from boarding. U.S. citizens can choose to opt-out of the face scan, but some argue that the availability of this option isn’t made clear.

Congress has taken notice of the program’s lack of direction; last month U.S. Senators Ed Markey (D-MA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security insisting that formal rules be implemented before Florida expands the face-scanning program. They also requested statistics about the program’s accuracy and impostor detection rates. In other words, does the program even work?

“We request that DHS not only include the ‘match rates,’ indicating how often facial scans ‘match’ photos contained in a database, but also the ‘true reject’ rate–the rate at which travelers using fraudulent credentials are accurately rejected,” read the letter.

According to Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center, some research shows facial recognition programs are less accurate when it comes to racial minorities, women, and children. This is due to the lack of diversity in the photographs used to train the program, researchers say.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” said Rudolph, expressing his concern with Orlando’s expansion of the face-scanning program. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

The Orlando International Airport is Florida’s busiest airport, with nearly 6 million international travelers passing through last year, a record-breaking number. Steve Karoly, acting assistant administrator at TSA, said biometric security “will make things a little bit easier, more efficient at an airport environment.”

Earlier last year, President Trump signed an executive order encouraging the expansion of the biometric security program. According to NPR, the CBP hopes to install face scanners in all U.S. airports in four years.ARTICLE:Protesters jam Senate office building to protest Trump 'zero tolerance' policyHundreds of women gathered in the lobby of a Senate office building Thursday to protest the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.

The protesters, who came from all over the country, demanded an end to the detention of families illegally crossing the southern border, as well as the abolishment of ICE.

ARTICLE:With Housing Assistance About to Be Yanked Away, Sen. Warrren Excoriates 'Shameful' Failure to Help Puerto RicansWith just hours before a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deadline hits Puerto Rican hurricane survivors—ending the Transitional Sheltering Assistance and pushing roughly 1,800 families out of their temporary housing—Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Friday is urging the agency to extend the cutoff date for the assistance and admonishing its failure to activate a longer-term housing assistance program.

She also called it "shameful" that Republicans thwarted a legislative effort that would have offered needed relief:

Tomorrow, thousands of Puerto Rican evacuees will lose federal housing assistance & many will be left homeless. @FEMA refuses to set up the longer-term disaster housing program used after Katrina & Sandy. And the GOP is blocking legislation that would do it. This is shameful. pic.twitter.com/AV4U2i5BV1 — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 29, 2018

"They have nowhere to go," Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said Thursday on the Senate floor. "Some of them have lost everything because of these storms."

"Too many are still unable to find work or to find affordable housing. … For many of them, the only thing that they have is the help that FEMA is providing," he added.

Of the Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP), which would provide longer-term assistance, not being activated, he asked, "If it was good enough for the people fleeing New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, why isn't it good enough for the people that are equally devastated now in Florida having fled the deplorable conditions in their native island, our fellow U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico?"

His relief bill was rejected.

Citing the "dire need" still facing Puerto Ricans nine months after Hurricane Maria hit the island, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) joined Warren in spearheading a letter to FEMA Administrator Brock Long and Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson.

"FEMA's June 30th TSA deadline is forcing families to return to Puerto Rico before they have a home or school to return to and we will not stand for it," the bicameral letter (pdf), also signed by over a dozen lawmakers including Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), states.

It goes on to say that the "assistance provided by FEMA and HUD has not amply addressed the island's vast infrastructural devastation."

"DHAP has historically been activated within two weeks of a disaster, while Puerto Ricans have waited over eight months for relief," the lawmakers write.

"Activate DHAP, extend the June 30the deadline, and help heal Puerto Rico," the letter concludes.ARTICLE:Affirming Belief That Waters Are for Drilling and Pillaging, Trump Erases Ocean Protection PolicyThe Trump administration's "assault on our oceans" continued on Tuesday with an executive order that rescinds an Obama-era policy aimed at bolstering the health of the oceans and the Great Lakes.

"In one stroke of the pen, we have gone from hard-earned, responsible stewardship of the ocean to short-term, reckless, blind pursuit of a buck and a vote."

—marine biologist Jane Lubchenco"Oil drillers and other industry interests are cheering," environmental group Heal the Bay tweeted following Trump's action.

The new executive order revokes the 2010 National Ocean Policy put in place following the Deepwater Horizon disaster and which, as Earthjustice notes, "was built on decades of science, public input, and bipartisan recommendations."

Trump's new order calls for "promot[ing] ocean industries" and establishes the interagency Ocean Policy Committee. The White House states that the committee "will focus on growing the ocean economy," and says the president "is rolling back excessive bureaucracy created by the previous administration."

More to the point, as The Hill reports, "The order encourages more drilling and other industrial uses of the oceans and Great Lakes."

Coastal states and economies will bear the cost, & guess who gains? Oil and gas. #ProtectOurCoast pic.twitter.com/kNrdU9mhQc — AlaskaWild ‍ (@alaskawild) June 20, 2018

Among the critics of the new order is noted marine biologist Jane Lubchecno, a former NOAA administrator who helped create the National Ocean Policy.

"In one stroke of the pen, we have gone from hard-earned, responsible stewardship of the ocean to short-term, reckless, blind pursuit of a buck and a vote," she tweeted.

According to NRDC senior policy analyst Alison Chase, the new order is simply "irresponsible."

"There is no longer a requirement to work with states to provide for coordinated ocean protection and there is no longer a national policy to promote healthy ocean ecosystems," she explained.

"We reject the administration's false argument that federal management of the oceans prevents their productive and sustainable use," said Jacqueline Savitz, Oceana's chief policy officer for North America. "Strong and effective regulations lay out 'rules of the road' that safeguard our health, safety, and natural resources. These safeguards play an essential role in balancing the interests of private users of the oceans with the broader need for conservation of ocean resources for all Americans," she argued.

The shift, added Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director with the Center for Biological Diversity, "makes it crystal clear that Trump views our oceans solely as a source of profits for the oil industry and other polluters. Industrializing our oceans and coastal areas is exactly what we don't need, especially when whales, sea turtles, and other marine animals are already struggling against a long list of threats."

Lawmakers also added to the chorus of criticism. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), for one, warned that the administration "is doing everything it can to allow another BP oil spill."

In addition, House Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee called for a hearing on the issue. In a letter sent Tuesday to committee chairman Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), the Democrats called the new order "short-sighted" and underscored that "healthy oceans are central to the livelihoods of millions of Americans."ARTICLE:With Human Rights Crisis Still Underway, Fast to End 'Zero Tolerance' Takes Aim at Trump's CrueltyHuman rights activists on Sunday are entering the second day of a 24-day fast in protest of the Trump administration's cruel immigration polices at the Southern border, which have left roughly 2,000 children still separated from their parents.

"We don't want internment camps in the United States. We don't want people in shackles and tent cities for a misdemeanor. That isn't justice or compassion for children," said Kerry Kennedy, president of the advocacy organization Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, to MSNBC near the prison for migrant children in Tornillo, Texas.

The group, along with La Union del Pueblo Entero (LUPE), Texas Civil Rights Project (TCRP), and bilingual multimedia platform Neta, are calling for the fasting "chain"—the idea being that after a 24-hour period, the faster passes the action on to another person. Among those who've committed to taking part already include noted actors Martin Sheen, Alfre Woodard, Levar Burton, and Evan Rachel Wood, as well as Democratic lawmakers including Rep. Anthony Brown (Md.), Sen. Ed Markey (Mass.), Rep. Barbara Lee (Calif.).

Join our fast to end “zero-tolerance” here: https://t.co/APDfsJqLaX Day 2 of #BreakBreadNotFamilies — Texas Civil Rights Project (@TXCivilRights) June 24, 2018

While President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order ending the imprisonment of migrant children without their parents, it did little to quell outrage from the rights groups. A press statement from RFK Human Rights says that "the administration has moved toward the indefinite detention of families as the 'solution.' This is not only immoral, it is also illegal under U.S. and international law."

In the face of ongoing outrage, a statement released late Saturday from DHS said over 522 children have been reunified with their families and that 2,053 children were still in the custody. As CNN reports, the new plan means

those children will keep waiting in custody, with reunifications only happening once the parents' deportation proceedings are completed. The families will either be reunited before deportation or, if the parent is released from detention, after the parent applies to serve as the child's sponsor under HHS rules.

Every second more a child remains without their families is more trauma, stressed The Arc, an organization that advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

"We are still in the midst of a civil and human rights crisis," stressed Peter Berns, CEO of the group, in a statement Sunday. "Children who have already been separated from their parents should be reunited as soon as possible. This is an urgent situation for all children involved and in many cases irrevocable damage has already been done. For children with intellectual and developmental disabilities, who rely on their loved ones for care, security, and support, particularly for their unique needs, it is of paramount importance they are reunited with their families."

Rep. Lee, for her part, told reporters Saturday, "These children are traumatized," and called the zero-tolerance "barbaric." She added in a tweet: "This is a violation of human rights."

SUNDAY BEST -- SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OKLA.) to CHUCK TODD on NBC’S “MEET THE PRESS”: TODD: “Do you feel as if the White House has been fully transparent with the American public about what they’re trying to do here?” LANKFORD: “I don’t, actually. This has been one of the great frustrations. The White House has not been clear about how bad the Flores settlement is. They’ve tried to say it, and say it, and say it. The challenge is you shouldn’t just allow anyone to come in at any time to view a spot where there are children present.”

-- HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY CHAIRMAN MIKE MCCAUL of TEXAS on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY”: “I think, you know, to set forth a policy and then have to reverse it is not a consistent message obviously, to be candid with you. But I think – I think -- I wouldn’t fault the administration on this; I would fault the United States Congress, who has the power to change the laws that will stop this from happening again, and yet we can’t seem to get this done.”

-- TOM BOSSERT, Trump’s former homeland security adviser, with GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS on ABC’S “THIS WEEK”: “I’m glad to be here to try to explain it because this week has just been gripping imagery and terrible optics for the administration. So part of this was avoidable. The attorney general’s requirement and his memo for zero tolerance said to his us attorneys where practicable and almost from the outset, although it’s an understandable and righteous decision to prosecute any illegal entrant into the country, almost from the outset we didn't have the capacity to detain these parents and children -- together or separately.”

-- SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WIS.) speaks with JAKE TAPPER on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: “Well, the most recent information we have from DHS is they have reunited about 21 percent of those children that were separated from their families under this new enforcement policy. … But the Flores decision, for example, really initiated in 1985. And so this -- this is just a huge problem.

“We don't have the capacity to handle all the unaccompanied children, all the family units that are now flooding our border because of a host of a judicial decisions, legal precedent, and laws, I think very well-intentioned, but have negative unintended consequences that have created this -- these incentives for people to flood our borders.”

-- L.A. TIMES’ CHRISTINE MAI-DUC: “Trump’s immigration agenda forces California GOP candidates to navigate a tricky course”: “Rep. Mimi Walters started last week on message. On Monday, the Irvine Republican tweeted a news story about the tax cuts she helped pass, a central theme of her reelection campaign and her party’s effort to keep control of the House after the November midterms.

“Less than a day later, Walters felt the need to pivot to President Trump’s crisis du jour: Audio of wailing children and photos of kids in detention shelters had sparked bipartisan outrage over Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from parents arrested for crossing the border illegally. …

“Until recently, it seemed most candidates from both parties were content to concentrate on ‘kitchen table’ economic issues this year — Republicans on the effects of Trump’s tax cut package and Democrats on GOP votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. … The issue has vexed both parties for decades, but it hasn’t often become a central issue in national congressional elections. But Trump’s hard-line rhetoric in 2016 drew new voters to the Republican Party and helped him win.” https://lat.ms/2yCh75s

-- UP NEXT … ABC’S TARA PALMERI: “Republicans prepare bill allowing migrant children to be detained more than 20 days”: “Republican lawmakers are preparing to vote on a more narrow immigration bill that would allow immigrant children to stay in detention facilities with their parents for more than 20 days, senior White House and Hill officials tell ABC News.

“The bill would eliminate the so-called Flores settlement that requires that children be released from detention after 20 days, fixing a flaw in President Trump's executive order that mandates that children and parents not be separated during detention. The House is scheduled to vote on a larger ‘compromise’ immigration bill early next week that would include DACA, border security and visas. But the bill is not expected to get enough votes to pass in Congress. Sources tell ABC News that Hill leaders are expected to then vote on the more narrow bill.” https://abcn.ws/2MSJcZy

“‘Wacky Jacky is campaigning with Pocahontas,’ Mr. Trump announced, tagging Ms. Rosen with a derisive nickname of her own. ‘You believe this? In your state?’ ... The president, who drew a backlash in November for calling Ms. Warren ‘Pocahontas’ during an event with Navajo military veterans, noted that he had faced calls to apologize for the epithet. ‘I did apologize,’ Mr. Trump said. ‘To the memory of Pocahontas, I apologized.’” https://nyti.ms/2yF66R0

DAVID SIDERS in RENO: “Trump-Warren split-screen offers sneak peek at 2020 campaign”: “It’s a long way from 2020, but Saturday’s split-screen sketched out not only the tone of the next presidential election, but one of the pivotal issues — the president’s immigration policy and its effect on Latino voter turnout.

“Trump largely avoided the controversy surrounding his separation of children and their parents at the border, dismissing any electoral advantage for Democrats amid fallout from his administration’s zero-tolerance policy.

“But Democrats here in Reno saw the border controversy as rocket fuel for their efforts to register and turn out Latino voters in the hopes of ousting Republican Sen. Dean Heller in 2018 — and putting the state out of reach for Trump in 2020.” https://politi.co/2Kg1bXU

-- BLOOMBERG’S @LauraLitvan: “Trump mocks John McCain’s ‘thumbs down’ on the Obamacare repeal, tells Nevada Republican convention that ‘it doesn’t matter. We gutted it anyway.’”

-- @JenniferJJacobs: “Among those who greeted Trump at airport in Vegas today was billionaire Phil Ruffin, per @ToluseO. Ruffin is owner of Treasure Island casino and Trump’s partner in Trump International Hotel in Vegas. It was Ruffin’s jet Trump flew in to Moscow in 2013.”

JARED WATCH – “Kushner: The Palestinian people will ‘like’ the Trump peace plan” – Jewish Insider: “The Trump Administration is expected to make public the much-anticipated Middle East plan ‘soon’ amid the Palestinian Authority’s refusal to engage with the U.S. negotiation team, President Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner said in an interview with the Al-Quds daily news publication.

“‘We have continued our work on the plan and on building consensus on what is realistically achievable today and what will endure for the future. If President Abbas is willing to come back to the table, we are ready to engage; if he is not, we will likely air the plan publicly,’ Kushner said. ...

“The interview published in Arabic is seen as an attempt by the White House to talk directly to the Palestinian people about a plan, Kushner believes, they will welcome ‘because it will lead to new opportunities for them to have a much better life.’” http://bit.ly/2IkeLYx

NYT’S KEN VOGEL, “Trump Leaves His Mark on a Presidential Keepsake: Under President Trump, once stately medallions have gotten glitzier, and at least one featured a Trump property. Ethics watchdogs are worried”: “Concerned about running afoul of rules barring government resources from being used for partisan political purposes, the White House Counsel’s Office warned staff members not to display the [RNC’s] challenge coin, or any paraphernalia with Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan, in government buildings.

“Outside ethics watchdogs say the ‘Make America Great Again’ coins shouldn’t be distributed to military personnel — a traditional use of presidential challenge coins — since the military is supposed to be walled off from politics. And those watchdogs warn that coins featuring Mr. Trump’s properties, such as Mar-a-Lago, should not be produced using government resources — including funds, work hours or even phone calls and emails — since federal ethics laws prohibit the use of public resources to promote private businesses.” With 19 pix of coins on one page https://nyti.ms/2MUKG5B

“Sanders’ response was immediate, Wilkinson said: “‘That’s fine. I’ll go.”’ Sanders went back to the table, picked up her things and walked out. The others at her table had been welcome to stay, Wilkinson said. But they didn’t, so the servers cleared away the cheese plates and glasses. ‘They offered to pay,’ Wilkinson said. ‘I said, “No. It’s on the house.”’ … Another Red Hen in the District was at pains to make clear that it had no affiliation with Wilkinson’s place.” https://wapo.st/2KgNNq0

-- Sarah Sanders (@PressSec): “[Friday] night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so”.

FROM JOANNE KENEN: GETTING THE OBAMACARE BAND BACK TOGETHER – The five Democratic committee chairmen who wrote the Affordable Care Acts reunited for the first time Saturday at Spotlight Health, the opening session of the Aspen Ideas Festival. Four have left Congress (Chris Dodd, Max Baucus from the Senate, Henry Waxman and George Miller from the House – all of whom entered Congress together as Watergate babies in 1974). The fifth. Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, is retiring this year.

None have any regrets, even though the vitriol over the ACA was a big factor in Democrats’ loss of both the House and the Senate. In fact, several of them described it as their proudest achievement, laying the groundwork for health care for all Americans – an achievement that the Republicans have weakened but not obliterated. Asked if they’d do it all over again, knowing what they know now of the implementation foul-ups and the political costs, all said an unequivocal yes. “Your damn right,” Levin said. “Without a doubt,” Baucus said. “What’s the alternative – not pass it?” Miller said.

But they cautioned that Democrats need to focus on the commitment to universal health care in 2020, without setting up an intraparty fight over single payer, Medicare for all, or anything else that can split the party and diminish prospects for defeating President Trump. After the panel, Baucus told POLITICO’s Joanne Kenen that he’s come around to favoring single payer – but not immediately. “That’s not the message for 2020,” he told her. “But it’s not just aspirational. Single payer is where we’ve got to go.”

Driving the Day

ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ’s double-digit drubbing of HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIRMAN JOE CROWLEY in last night’s New York primary is as seismic of a defeat in the House since Eric Cantor lost to Dave Brat in 2014. (It’s kind of different than Cantor, but keep reading, we’ll get there.)

THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS -- which Crowley chairs -- was beginning, for the first time, to allow a conversation about a transition toward a new leadership structure, which he could’ve led. Some allies and friends of NANCY PELOSI were even envisioning a scenario -- far off, for sure -- in which she served as speaker for some period of time in a Democratic majority, and set up a situation in which Crowley could take the reins.

Story Continued Below

NO LONGER. Just like when Cantor was turned out of office in 2014, the Democratic leadership structure is going to be confronted with serious upheaval. To be sure, Crowley was not perfect for House Democrats. He was a middle-aged white man as the party turned more diverse. He was a big-city party boss in an age of insurgency. But, like Cantor -- who also ran counter to party trends at the time -- Crowley was seen as safe and stable.

NOW, the race for the Democratic leadership will be wide open. It’s too early to say definitively what this means for PELOSI, JIM CLYBURN and STENY HOYER, the 78-, 77- and 79-year olds who have been in Congress a combined 93 years.

IS THE MESSAGE you got from last night that the party wants leaders in their upper 70s who have been in Washington for three decades? Seventy-something year old leaders, have a laundry list of votes and positions they’ve taken and been part of the machine the base is railing on. IT’S IMPORTANT TO NOTE: 63 Democrats voted against Pelosi in the last leadership election. More than a dozen candidates this cycle have said they would follow suit.

A SENIOR HOUSE DEMOCRATIC AIDE, however, pushed back on the idea that Crowley’s defeat has any bearing on Pelosi: “Tonight’s developments have little practical impact on the race for the top Democratic slot since Pelosi has made clear that she’s staying put. Real question is which younger Members of leadership will step up in their leadership roles. One real way to do that now is to raise money now. We literally are in a position of where we cannot afford the opportunity that exists on the map.”

WHY THIS IS NOT EXACTLY LIKE ERIC CANTOR’S DEFEAT. Cantor lost to Dave Brat in 2014, but Brat was emblematic of the tea party wave that had come ashore four years earlier. The Republican Party had already been struggling with -- and confronting -- the rightward-shifting elements of its party. Democrats -- especially elected Democrats in Congress -- have not had to do that yet.

-- CHARTING THE FALL … GLORIA PAZMINO and LAURA NAHMIAS: “From future speaker to primary loser: Inside Crowley’s crushing defeat”: “Ocasio-Cortez pounded the pavement and never wavered from her message: Crowley was out of touch with his district and could no longer represent a community of Latino, Asian and African immigrants whose families and friends face an existential threat from the Trump Administration.” https://bit.ly/2MojNWz

GREG GIROUX -- Bloomberg’s Hill election expert (@greggiroux): “Congress has never had a woman under 30 in its membership. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is 28. #ny14 … The youngest woman ever elected? Elise Stefanik (R-NY) at 30 in 2014. She's seeking 3rd term in #ny21”.

-- “Who Is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? A Democratic Giant Slayer,” by NYT’s Vivian Wang: “She has never held elected office. She is still paying off her student loans. She is 28 years old. ‘Women like me aren’t supposed to run for office,’ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a viral campaign video released last month. They certainly weren’t supposed to win.” https://nyti.ms/2lDYoxi … CBSN interview with Ocasio-Cortez https://cbsn.ws/2MuMYHF … Intercept profile http://bit.ly/2ItZDYU

-- WAPO’S DAVE WEIGEL: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The Democrat who challenged her party’s establishment — and won” https://wapo.st/2N0OzGd

STAT OF THE DAY … OCASIO-CORTEZ spent $128,140 from the beginning of April to June 6. Crowley spent $1.1 million over the same period.

REP. STEVE STIVERS (R-OHIO), the chairman of the NRCC, weighs in with an 11 p.m. message to Team Playbook: “2018 Democratic Primaries require a major investment from establishment D’s, or the results wildly favor progressive candidates.

“When they spend, they take money from the General Election. ($10 million spent in California - that’s 5 less races in the Fall) When they don’t spend, they get less electable candidates (Eastman, Balter & Delgado).

“Either outcome is good for us. And Crowley losing means there is no clear alternative to Nancy Pelosi.”

****** A message from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: There are no winners in a global trade war. Here’s a breakdown of the states and industries hardest hit by retaliatory tariffs on American exports. www.TheWrongApproach.com. ******

THINK OF THIS … EVERY SINGLE “next” House Democratic leader is gone. Joe Crowley lost. Xavier Becerra is AG of California. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is a senator. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida to the DNC, where she was pushed out of the chairmanship.

-- HEATHER CAYGLE ON THE LEADERSHIP MACHINATIONS: “Crowley’s defeat could put pressure on other members of the caucus to declare their ambitions now, given that spots rarely open up in House Democratic leadership without an assumed successor.

“Chief among them is Rep. Linda Sanchez, vice chairwoman of the caucus and No. 5 behind Crowley. The California Democrat had been seen as the most vulnerable member of the leadership team after publicly calling last fall for Pelosi, Hoyer and Assistant Minority Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) to move on to make way for a new generation.

“Sanchez could declare her intentions to run for House Democratic Caucus chair now that Crowley is no longer in the picture. But the opening could also prompt other younger, ambitious members to vie for the post. Lawmakers including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) and Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) were being floated by Democratic members and aides Tuesday night.” https://politi.co/2MuEpfZ

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION? Tough to say. Republicans were gleeful that they can focus their party’s attention on Pelosi, whose approval ratings are at their lowest point since October of 2010.

… BUT, BUT, BUT: Yes, Ocasio-Cortez’s message was a progressive one, but it was also anti incumbent. “It’s time we acknowledge that not all Democrats are the same. That a Democrat who takes corporate money, profits off foreclosure, doesn’t live here, doesn’t send his kids to our schools, doesn’t drink our water or breathe our air cannot possibly represent us,” she said in her much ballyhooed campaign video.

-- THAT’S a message that could fell longtime Republicans or Democrats across the country. The video http://bit.ly/2IwLjib

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR 2020 … THE LEFTWARD LURCH ... If you thought Democrats were already leaning left, look now for the lurch. After last night, can you envision the forces running the Democratic Party today anointing a Joe Biden-type candidate?

PRESIDENT TRUMP ON CROWLEY -- @realDonaldTrump at 10:18 p.m.: “Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi’s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he’s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!”

THIS TAKE is unlikely to get repeated by many people who understand what happened last night. Crowley got beat by a woman who ran to his left.

-- DONOVAN faces Democrat Max Rose, an Army veteran, in the district, which includes Staten Island and Brooklyn. Trump won the district by 10 in 2016, but Democrats carried it in the past. Democrats are hoping it’s a competitive race after Donovan ran to the right to beat Grimm.

“He was the official left to sit in the president’s chair after Mr. Trump left an acrimonious G7 summit in Quebec early this month. In his role Mr. Eissenstat, who was a key adviser to former National Economic Council head Gary Cohn and previously served as the top trade staffer on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, was a major player in discussions on trade and China policy.

“Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Federal District Court in San Diego said children under 5 must be reunited with their parents within 14 days, and he ordered that all children must be allowed to talk to their parents within 10 days. “The unfortunate reality is that under the present system, migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property,” the judge wrote.” https://nyti.ms/2KmFUfb

WHAT THE TRAVEL BAN RULING MEANS … “Travel-ban ruling could embolden Trump in remaking the U.S. immigration system,” by WaPo’s David Nakamura: “President Trump’s victory Tuesday in the Supreme Court’s ratification of his travel ban marked a milestone in his attempt to paint broad swaths of immigrants as dangerous — a rhetorical strategy that has underpinned the administration’s sweeping efforts to unilaterally curtail immigration. Since taking office 18 months ago, Trump has amplified, and attempted to codify into policy, his campaign-trail warnings of the threats posed by foreigners who attempt to enter the United States, including those who come through legal channels....

“Critics expressed fears that the court’s ruling would embolden Trump to further test the limits of his statutory authority to enforce border-control laws without explicit approval from lawmakers.” https://wapo.st/2KeOKzK

ON THE WORLD STAGE -- “U.S. Toughens Stance on Future Iran Oil Exports,” by WSJ’s Ian Talley: “The U.S. threatened to slap sanctions on countries that don’t cut oil imports from Iran to ‘zero’ by Nov. 4, part of the Trump administration’s push to further isolate Tehran both politically and economically, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Buyers of Iranian crude had expected the U.S. would allow them time to reduce their oil imports over a much longer period, by issuing sanctions waivers for nations that made significant efforts to cut their purchases.

“That expectation was partly based on previous comments from top Trump officials, as well as the Obama administration’s earlier effort to wean the world off Iranian oil over several years. But the senior State Department official said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t plan to issue any waivers and would instead be asking other Middle Eastern crude exporters over the coming days to ensure oil supply to global markets.” https://on.wsj.com/2N5gQeq

JOE BIDEN speaks to WaPo’s JOSH ROGIN in Copenhagen: “European leaders see President Trump as increasingly unpredictable, antagonistic and disrespectful, both in public and private, and that is having a devastating effect on the U.S.-European relationship and the transatlantic alliance, according to former vice president Joe Biden. ‘The things that are the most debilitating from the perspective of most of the Europeans is the way he conducts himself when he is with allies,’ Biden told me in an interview at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, a gathering of Western leaders to discuss the plight of democracy worldwide. ‘Several of them have said to me the degree of disrespect shown is debilitating.’

“One European diplomat told me that in a private White House meeting in March, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven explained to Trump that Sweden, although not a member of NATO, partners with the alliance on a case-by-case basis. Trump responded that the United States should consider that approach. A senior administration official told me Trump was joking. I asked Biden whether this crisis in the democratic world makes him want to run for president in 2020. He said no. ‘It makes me feel guilty about not wanting to [run for president],’ he said. ‘But it doesn’t make me want to. I’m not looking to live in the White House, I’ve seen it up close.’ He then added: ‘But all kidding aside, I don’t know what I’m going to do.’” https://wapo.st/2tyKqkE

THE INVESTIGATIONS …

-- “House panel pushes resolution for DOJ to hand over Russia probe documents,” by Kyle Cheney and John Bresnahan: “The House Rules Committee is preparing to advance a resolution demanding that the Justice Department turn over reams of documents connected to special counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation, a move that would put the measure on the cusp of consideration by the House as soon as this week.

“The committee is slated to consider the proposal on Wednesday afternoon, a day after it was approved by the Judiciary Committee. The proposal, offered by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), demands that the Justice Department turn over a broad slate of documents by July 6.

“The measure, a so-called resolution of inquiry, is unenforceable but would, for the first time, put the Republican-led House on record demanding sensitive documents, escalating a confrontation that has so far been relegated to a handful of powerful House committees.” https://politi.co/2Ksv085

WEDNESDAY LISTEN -- ANNA spoke with the founding members of the BLACK WOMEN’S CONGRESSIONAL ALLIANCE in the latest “Women Rule” podcast. Via REENA FLORES: “‘We literally show up with our binder full of women’”: “There is little comprehensive information about the gender and racial makeup of congressional staff offices. But according to 2015 data from the Joint Center for Political and Economic studies, a nonprofit think tank, only about 7 percent of senior Senate staffers (a chief of staff, legislative director, communications director or staff director for a committee) were minorities.

“And even when black women do make it into the halls of Congress, it can be difficult to thrive there. ‘In my boss’ office when we came in … the expectations weren’t high,’ [Rhonda] Foxx recalled. ‘People were like, ‘If you want to be taken seriously, maybe you should hire a white man as your LD,’ or legislative director.’

“There are always micro-aggressions, the chief of staff said, but her solution to them is to view it as fuel for her ambitions. ‘When you are with your boss and they ask you, ‘Are you the secretary?’ or, ‘Are you the scheduler?’ — because no one assumes that we’re chief of staffs or comms directors — let that be your fire,’ Foxx said.” Listen to the full convo with Sen.

COMING ATTRACTIONS -- “White House eyes Helsinki for Trump-Putin sitdown,” by Annie Karni and Andrew Restuccia: “The White House is blocking off three days on the back end of President Donald Trump’s mid-July trip to the United Kingdom and Brussels, leaving room for a potential summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Plans for a potential sit-down are still being finalized, White House sources warned. But the current front-runner venue under consideration for the meeting, a source familiar with the planning said, is Helsinki, the capital of Finland.

“The location would offer Putin his desired neutral ground in a country close enough to Russia that he could return to Moscow in time for the final World Cup match on July 15. While nothing final about a potential summit has been put in writing, ‘everyone’s preparing as if it’s Helsinki,’ said a person familiar with the planning.” https://politi.co/2N3vZNA

Both international and national observers and analysts argued that almost four decades of conflict had fragmented Afghanistan to the extent that reconciliation and acceptance of each other were going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. ...

“Another assumption was that Taliban fighters would never stop fighting and accept their fellow citizens. But our cease-fire was endorsed by the Taliban leadership and relished by their fighters. Ordinary people welcomed them warmly and demonstrated that every Afghan is tired of war and desires an end to it at any cost.” https://nyti.ms/2IziDFc

DATA DU JOUR -- “Women underrepresented in key jobs at FBI, DEA, ATF and Marshals Service,” by WaPo’s Devlin Barrett: “Female FBI agents, DEA agents, ATF agents and deputy marshals are still distinct minorities in the ranks of law enforcement, according to a new audit that also found women are rarely promoted to key jobs at the nation’s premier law enforcement agencies. Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz issued a report Tuesday detailing stark differences between how women and men are employed in federal law enforcement.

“In 2016, women comprised just 16 percent of criminal investigators employed at the agencies — even though women account for 57 percent of the rest of the agencies’ workforce. Within the work cultures of those agencies, criminal investigators — special agents or deputy marshals — are widely regarded as the most important and influential employees, and the ones most likely to receive big promotions. The numbers vary by agency. At the FBI, about 1 in 5 special agents are women. The ratio is about 1 in 10 for deputy marshals.” https://wapo.st/2Ko57Gc

“That may prove a Pyrrhic victory, because in the case of Israel, it may politicize support for Israel in a way that we haven’t seen before. ...

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has launched efforts to create a vaccine that would protect people from most flu strains, all at once, with a single shot.

Over the years, I’ve written many articles refuting claims that vaccines are safe and effective, but we’ll put all that aside for the moment and follow the bouncing ball.

Massachusetts Senator and big spender, Ed Markey, has introduced a bill that would shovel no less than a billion dollars toward the universal flu-vaccine project.

Here is a sentence from an NIAID press release that mentions one of several research approaches:

“NIAID Vaccine Research Center scientists have initiated Phase 1/2 studies of a universal flu vaccine strategy that includes an investigational DNA-based vaccine (called a DNA ‘prime’)…”

This is quite troubling, if you know what the phrase “DNA vaccine” means. It refers to what the experts are touting as the next generation of immunizations.

Instead of injecting a piece of a virus into a person, in order to stimulate the immune system, synthesized genes would be shot into the body. This isn’t traditional vaccination anymore. It’s gene therapy.

In any such method, where genes are edited, deleted, added, no matter what the pros say, there are always “unintended consequences,” to use their polite phrase. The ripple effects scramble the genetic structure in numerous unknown ways.

Here is the inconvenient truth about DNA vaccines—

They will permanently alter your DNA

The reference is the New York Times, 3/15/15, “Protection Without a Vaccine.” It describes the frontier of research—the use of synthetic genes to “protect against disease,” while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:

“By delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

“’The sky’s the limit,’ said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.”

“The first human trial based on this strategy — called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. — is underway, and several new ones are planned.” [That was three years ago.]

“I.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.”

Here is the punchline: “The viruses invade human cells with their DNA payloads, and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA. If all goes well, the new genes instruct the cells to begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.”

Read that again: “the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA.”

Alteration of the human genetic makeup.

Not just a “visit.” Permanent residence. And once a person’s DNA is changed, he will live with that change—and all the ripple effects in his genetic makeup—for the rest of his life.

The Times article taps Dr. David Baltimore for an opinion:

“Still, Dr. Baltimore says that he envisions that some people might be leery of a vaccination strategy that means altering their own DNA, even if it prevents a potentially fatal disease.”

Yes, some people might be leery. If they have two or three working brain cells.

This is genetic roulette with a loaded gun. Anyone and everyone on Earth injected with a DNA vaccine will undergo permanent and unknown genetic changes…

And the further implications are clear. Vaccines can be used as a cover for the injections of any and all genes, whose actual purpose is re-engineering humans in far-reaching ways.

The emergence of this Frankenstein technology is paralleled by a shrill push to mandate vaccines, across the board, for both children and adults. The pressure and propaganda are planet-wide.

The freedom and the right to refuse vaccines has always been vital. It is more vital than ever now.

It means the right to preserve your inherent DNA.ARTICLE:Altering human genetics through vaccination Jun 26 by Jon RappoportThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has launched efforts to create a vaccine that would protect people from most flu strains, all at once, with a single shot.

This article (Altering Human Genetics Through Vaccination) was originally created and published by Jon Rappaport’s Blog and is re-posted here with permission.ARTICLE:The People Behind Your Tech Addiction Are Now Trying to Curb ItWhen news broke of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica allegedly using private Facebook data to influence the 2016 presidential election, something changed in the public imagination regarding technology and social media. Suddenly, proof materialized that the information we uploaded to the platform was being harvested a political firm to try to swing an election.

None of this would have been possible if not for the fact that our daily lives are increasingly being conducted through digital media. Cambridge Analytica was only able to acquire Facebook data because millions of users had provided that data. The way an entire population communicates has fundamentally changed.

But a group of ex-insiders from the tech industry wants to curb the harm, even harness the power of digital media for good. In 2013, they founded the nonprofit Center for Humane Technology understanding that smartphones are designed to capture and keep attention. Most people don’t understand how they are being manipulated by their smartphones. The CHT was created to help them recognize and resist unhealthy habits often fostered by tech design.

Co-founder Tristan Harris, an ex-Google employee who once held the title of design ethicist and now serves as CHT’s executive director, frames it as a battle nothing less than the most important issue facing the modern world.

“I don’t know a more urgent problem than this, because this problem is underneath all other problems,” he said at an April 2017 TED conference. “It’s not just taking away our agency to spend our attention and live the lives that we want—it’s changing the way that we have our conversations, it’s changing our democracy, and it’s changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships we want with each other. And it affects everyone, because a billion people have one of these in their pocket.”

In terms of worldwide numbers, a billion people is a conservative estimate. More than 2 billion people own smartphones, with that number expected to reach 2.87 billion in 2020. In the United States, smartphones have grown increasingly common over the last seven years. According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of American adults own smartphones, up from 35 percent in 2011. A whopping 94 percent of people aged 18–29 own smartphones, as do 89 percent of people aged 30–49 and 73 percent of people aged 60–64. There’s no truly significant drop until you hit 65 and older, but even then, the ownership number is still 46 percent.

Smartphone and tablet use has also seen a dramatic increase among children. Among children ages 0–8, 98 percent lived in homes with some kind of mobile device in 2017, compared to 52 percent in 2011. Over the same time frame, the percentage of those children who had their own devices rose from less than 1 percent to 42 percent, and their average time spent using a mobile device went from five minutes per day to 48 minutes per day.

“Anything that induces pleasure has, at its extreme, addiction.”

The problem is that this technology spreading so rapidly throughout the world is designed to make a profit, and profitability is measured in consumer time spent using a product. The only way to compete in such an industry is to make a product as addictive as possible.

The term “addictive” is a controversial one. The psychological community remains divided on whether behavioral compulsions can be classified as addiction alongside physical compulsions brought on by substances. However, with the addition of gambling addiction to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 2013 and the inclusion of gaming disorder in the World Health Organization’s latest update of the International Classification of Diseases, the idea of tech addiction is becoming more accepted. Dr. Robert Lustig, an neuroendocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco, says his work as an advisor for CHT consists primarily of explaining the reality of tech addiction.

“Anything that induces pleasure has, at its extreme, addiction,” Lustig says. “And those exposures can be chemical or behavioral.”

After the addition of gambling to the DSM, “everything changed about the definition of addiction,” he says. “And so under that new rubric of tolerance and dependence, social media, internet gaming, and technology fit the criteria for addiction. There’s no withdrawal. You don’t need withdrawal anymore, because the neuroscience is the same.”

Regardless of the clinical definition, it’s clear that the neural processes that can cause addictive behavior—the brain’s release of dopamine as a reward response to pleasure—are the same processes being triggered by tech. According to Lustig, Facebook’s like button is a perfect example: If someone likes something you post on Facebook, your brain rewards you with a dopamine hit. However, wondering whether your friends will like your post creates stress, which heightens the dopamine effect. The result is continued Facebook use to alleviate the stress that Facebook created, with an increased shot of dopamine when the tension in the brain is briefly eased.

Harris, a former participant in Stanford University’s Persuasive Tech Lab, said in his TED conference speech that tech designers know exactly how to manipulate people into keeping their eyes on the screen: “There’s conferences and workshops that teach people all these covert ways of getting people’s attention and orchestrating people’s lives. And it’s because most people don’t know that that exists that this conversation is so important.”

“60 percent of families were concerned that their children were addicted to their phones.”

Harris believes tech products designed to be addictive are detrimental to everyone, but some of CHT’s strongest advocacy to date has come in the area of children’s health.

In February, CHT partnered with Common Sense Media, an organization that advocates on behalf of children growing up in the digital world, to launch the Truth About Tech campaign. It calls for a shift in values for tech companies—a conscious choice to act in the best interests of children even if that results in a decrease in profits.

“It’s in their business model,” says Colby Zintl, Common Sense’s vice president of external affairs. “They just are trying to make the best product that they possibly can, and, to be honest, our best interests and Facebook’s or Snapchat’s business model are at odds with one another.”

Zintl sees the Truth About Tech campaign as having three goals. The first is public awareness. Zintl believes that the more people know about the tech industry’s efforts to keep their attention, the more likely they are both to modify their own behavior and make informed choices about tech products as consumers.

The second goal is to have this kind of awareness taught in schools. “We want to graduate a new generation of people who think critically and behave responsibly online,” Zintl says. To that end, Common Sense has put together a free K–12 curriculum that is currently being implemented in 55,000 schools across the country. Developed with Harvard University, the material is age-appropriate, beginning with talking to kindergartners about what they’re watching on YouTube and eventually expanding to topics like ethical design and news literacy at the high school level.

Truth About Tech’s third goal is to encourage further research on the subject, preferably funded partly by tech companies themselves. Despite the newly expanded definition of addiction and increasing parental concern over high levels of tech use among children, there is insufficient research proving a net negative relationship between technology and child brain health.

“We use the term ‘addiction’ in a colloquial sense,” Zintl says. “In our report that we did in 2016, we found that 60 percent of families were concerned that their children were addicted to their phones, so that’s their phrase.” She adds, “The medical community is torn on this, and until we have more research and specifically research on the neurological effects on tech on kids’ brains, we can’t really say.”

Dr. Jenny Radesky, a pediatrician at the Michigan Medicine Pediatric Behavioral Clinic who has worked with Common Sense on the campaign, agrees that more research is required, particularly in the new era of mobile media consumption. “The older video gaming research was really spent on how many hours per day and what games are you playing, and whether you play alone or you play together with other people,” she says. “But now that gaming is so mobile and can be accessed instantly, my thinking is that it has the potential to take up more hours of the day. But we don’t yet have data on that.”

What is certain is that, if health risks can be definitively linked to technology, children are more susceptible to them than adults. Lustig explains this in terms of the development of the prefrontal cortex, which controls executive function and behavioral inhibition. The prefrontal cortex is the last part of the brain to myelinate, or create a fatty sheathe around neurons to protect them.

“Adolescents, who have an undeveloped prefrontal cortex, who are constantly being bombarded by dopaminergic input,” he says, “are under chronic neural stimulation. They can lose neurons. And if they lose neurons in adolescence, they ain’t coming back.”

Radesky believes the design of tech products isn’t necessarily malicious, but rather a result of companies seeing what works on adults and employing the same elements in products designed for children. But she is also well aware of the history of children being specifically targeted by industry.

“When the advertisement is built into your game, or the apps themselves are advertisements, apps are meant to create brand loyalty among different toys or different characters, or when there’s gamified features and all these instant direct rewards, I think it’s exponentially more influential on children,” she says.

CHT and Truth About Tech are making progress in their attempts to enact positive change. Recently, Google launched a new website, Digital Wellbeing. Designed to inform its users of technology concerns and provide information on how to regulate use, it is remarkably similar to CHT’s own website. Apple has taken similar actions—its “Families” page is dedicated to promoting responsible use of its products for parents and children. CHT is also in the process of drafting an internet developer’s code of ethics. But a greater goal, according to both Lustig and Zintl, is to subject the industry to outside regulation.

Zintl says she has seen some movement in the area of privacy regulation, pointing to a bill floating around California and a collaboration between her colleagues and U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, who is trying to introduce a bill calling for more research.

Ultimately, CHT wants the end result of its advocacy to be not only taking back power over our devices and our minds, but the redirection of that power toward human gain, not just the pursuit of profit.ARTICLE:Ethel Kennedy to join hunger strike in protest of family separationsRobert Kennedy’s widow, Ethel Kennedy, will take part in a hunger strike protesting President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, according to a report.

Nearly 50 other members of the political family will be joining Kennedy, 90, during the Saturday fast, organized by activist groups in honor of the nearly 2,500 children separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border, the Boston Globe reported.

“We want to find a way for people who can’t go down to the border to actually do something themselves at home that is concrete and creates change, and this is what we’re calling on them to do,” said Kerry Kennedy, Ethel and Robert’s daughter and head of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group.

The hunger strike will last 24 hours and participants are asked to make a donation to the organization Break Bread Not Families in place of the food they would have eaten.

Kerry Kennedy said her mom is “very joyful” about fasting for the cause.

In a statement, Ethel Kennedy said the executive order Trump signed last week halting the separations was “not a time to declare victory and go home.”

“Generations of Americans did not toil and sacrifice to build a country where children and their parents are placed in cages to advance a cynical political agenda,” the statement said.

Her grandson, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, will also participate.

“For children being starved of contact with their parents, the irreparable harm inflicted by our government multiplies every single day kids remain separated from their moms and dads,” he said in a statement.

The hunger strike is organized by RFK Human Rights, which Ethel Kennedy founded, along with La Union Del Pueblo Entero, The Texas Civil Rights Project and Neta.

Celebrities including Alec Baldwin, Keegan-Michael Key and Evan Rachel Wood announced they would be participating, as well as both senators from Massachusets, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren.ARTICLE:Face scans to be required for international travelers at Orlando airportORLANDO, Fla. — Florida’s busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, including US citizens, according to officials there.

The expected announcement Thursday at Orlando International Airport alarms some privacy advocates who say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don’t involve all international travelers at the airports like the program’s expansion in Orlando would. The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has images of people who should be on the flight, in order to verify the traveler’s identity.

US citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency “doesn’t seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out,” said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

US citizens at the Orlando airport will be able to opt out just like at the other airports if they don’t want to provide their photograph, Jennifer Gabris, a spokeswoman for the US Customs and Border Protection said in an email. However, a notice about a possible rule change for the program states that “US citizens may be required to provide photographs upon entering or departing the United States.”

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” he said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year.

Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans’ accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Two US senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

“It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport,” said the letter from US Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).ARTICLE:Millions Lack Food, Housing, and Healthcare, But 38 Democrats Just Joined GOP to Spend $716 Billion on Endless War and EmpireIn a vote that further "entrenches endless war and bloated Pentagon spending" and places greater nuclear capacity in the hands of President Donald Trump, 38 Democrats and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) joined nearly every Senate Republican on Monday to pass a $716 billion defense bill that boosts military spending by over $80 billion and authorizes another $21.6 billion for nuclear weapons programs.

"We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and healthcare...That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today."

—Sen. Bernie Sanders Had the Pentagon's budget simply remained the same as it was in 2017, Congress "could have funded public college for every student in the U.S. and had $12 billion left over," noted media analyst Adam Johnson.

But Democrats and Republicans decided to join hands once more late Monday—in an overwhelming 85-10 vote—to affirm that militarism and massive handouts to defense contractors top education, healthcare, and anti-hunger programs on the list of congressional priorities.

Slamming the bipartisan vote to pass the military measure—officially titled the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5515)—Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote: "We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and healthcare...That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today."

not that anyone cares but the Senate just passed a $716B defense bill for 2019, a 13% increase over 2017, or roughly $82B. Had the DOD's budget simply STAYED THE SAME we could have funded public college for every student in the US & had $12B left over. https://t.co/ScW0T138kh — Adam H.

Joining Sanders in voting against the military spending bill on Monday were Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

Meanwhile, these 38 Senate Democrats and King joined a nearly united GOP caucus in approving the measure:ARTICLE:'You Are Lying. Period': Trump DHS Secretary Blasted for Denying Existence of Family Separation Policy'You Are Lying. Period': Trump DHS Secretary Blasted for Denying Existence of Family Separation Policy

"This is a policy made solely by this administration, and you can stop it right now. And every second you don't you are directly responsible for unimaginable amounts of misery. Period."

In a "heinous lie" aimed at distorting the historical record and avoiding responsibility for the mass cruelty perpetuated on her watch, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen falsely claimed in a series of tweets late Sunday that the Trump administration does "not have a policy of separating families at the border."

"This misreporting by members [of Congress], press, and advocacy groups must stop. It is irresponsible and unproductive," Nielsen wrote, neglecting to mention data from her own department showing that nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families in just six weeks due to the Trump adminstration's so-called "zero tolerance" immigration policy.

Lawmakers, activists, and reporters who have persistently highlighted and denouncedthe Trump administration's family separation policy—which was officially unveiled byAttorney General Jeff Sessions in May—were quick to call out Nielsen's blatant lie on Sunday, pointing out that a quick look at her department's website is enough to expose the falsehood.

Prominently featured on the DHS's "fact sheet" for its zero tolerance policy, dated June 15, is the question: "Why Are Parents Being Separated From Their Children?"

DHS "may separate a parent or legal guardian from his or her child for several reasons, including situations where DHS cannot ascertain the parental relationship, when DHS determines that a child may be at risk with the presumed parent or legal guardian, or if a parent or legal guardian is referred for criminal prosecution, including for illegal entry," the website notes.

Todd Schulte, president of the advocacy group FWD.us, added that the DHS website also contains a flyer outlining "the steps a parent in Border Patrol or ICE custody can take to locate their child, once said child has been separated from them."

"This is a lie," Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) concluded in response to Nielsen's tweet on Sunday. "There is no law. There is no court mandate. This is a policy made solely by this administration, and you can stop it right now. And every second you don't you are directly responsible for unimaginable amounts of misery. Period."

By attempting to deny the very existence of the Trump administration's family separation policy, Nielsen flatly contradicted statements from other White House officials like Chief of Staff John Kelly and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who have celebrated the practice of ripping kids from their parents' arms as a strong "deterrent" against border crossings.

And as many were quick to point out following her tweet on Sunday, Nielsen herself acknowledged the policy that she now claims doesn't exist in an interview with NPR just days after Sessions announced the White House's "zero tolerance" plan.

"Operationally what that means is we will have to separate your family," Nielsen said, referring to the Trump administration's decision to refer for criminal prosecution all immigrants who cross the border illegally.

Responding to Nielsen's lie on Sunday, the ACLU explained, "You have a policy of criminally prosecuting any asylum seeker who crosses the border between ports of entry. Period. Parents go into custody and kids are shipped off to facilities—over a misdemeanor."ARTICLE:Orlando International Airport to scan faces of US citizensFlorida's busiest airport is becoming the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, including U.S. citizens, according to officials there.

(AP) - Florida's busiest airport will be the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, officials said Thursday, a move that pleases airport executives but worries privacy advocates.

Officials at Orlando International Airport said the expansion of face scans would speed up the time it takes for passengers to go through customs.

But some privacy advocates say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don't involve all international flights at the airports as the program's expansion in Orlando would.

The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has passport images of people who should be on the flight in order to verify the traveler's identity. The images are held in the database for 14 days before being deleted, said John Wagner, an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The face scan expansion is costing the Orlando airport authority $4 million. The program should be rolled out at other airports in other U.S. cities in the next year, Wagner said.

"We're comparing you against a photograph you've given the U.S. government for the purposes of travel," Wagner said. "You know your picture is being taken. You're standing in front of a camera. There's nothing subversive about this, and we're only comparing you against your passport photo."

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency "doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year. Face scans for arrivals and departures should be fully in place by the end of the year, although passengers landing at Orlando International Airport currently undergo them upon arriving. Passengers who had their photos taken Thursday at the Orlando airport took it in stride.

"It was fine, efficient, very fast," said Katrina Poulsen, a Denmark resident who arrived in Orlando on a flight from London.

Andrea Nabarria, who arrived on the same flight, said he understands the concerns about privacy but that passengers may have to give up something in exchange for beefed up security.

"At least that's what we're told," said Nabarria, an Italian who is a resident of Denmark.

Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans' accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Wagner said the agency hasn't seen discrepancies based on race or gender using face scans at the other airports.

The protest there and at the Justice Department was part of a day of civil disobedience organized by Women's March members leading up to a larger rally planned by them and other groups Saturday.

Some 1,000 protesters circled the Department of Justice as they chanted "DOJ Disobey" and "We Care." They paused for a moment of silence for the migrant children they said were unaccounted for.

Political and public outcry against the administration's policy of separating parents from children upon arrest prompted President Donald Trump to sign an executive order last week saying parents and children would be kept together in detention. Administration officials have offered different explanations for how the policy was being implemented, and how and when all approximately 2,300 children would be reunited with parents.

The executive order has "been signed but what are the actions that are being taken?" said Diane Dresdner, 60, who drove from Northern Virginia to help direct the protesters. "They're separating parents from children, they're also separating brothers from sisters and young siblings from older siblings. That's horrific. Horrific."

Laura Divito of Long Island, N.Y., said, "I don't believe anything that this particular president is saying and that's because of his history of constant lying."

"I don't know what kind of country I'm living in anymore because this is not the America that I know," she said. "What America has become is not the America I grew up with."

For others, however, the Trump administration's policies served to highlight an existing problem.

"Everyone keeps saying, 'This isn't the America that I know,' but I mean, this is," said Jill Manrique, 33, of Skokie, Ill. Manrique said she was compelled to participate partially because of her Mexican and Jewish heritage.

"I think it's important to not pretend America's this place that didn't do this before and that hasn't treated people like garbage, because it has," she added. "And now it's just time for everyone to wake up and change it."

After the Department of Justice protests, many of the women moved on to Capitol Hill, where they staged a sit-in at the Hart Office Building.

Eva Malecki, communications director for Capitol Police, said the department charged about 575 people with unlawfully demonstrating. She said they were being processed on the scene before being released.

Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut visited the protesters to show their support.

Duckworth, who had her new baby daughter in tow, told CNN "I wanted to show my support for the folks here today ... I could only imagine what it would be like to have my daughter -- my breastfeeding child -- ripped away from me the way some of these other moms' babies have been."

The protest was peaceful, CNN reported.

It wasn't the only immigration-related protest held in the country Thursday. In Portland, Ore., Department of Homeland Security officers in riot gear removed protesters camping out at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, KOIN-TV reported. Officers dismantled the protesters' tens, but more than 100 demonstrators remained outside the ICE building.

Police arrested and later released at least eight people in the Oregon protest.

Rob Sperling of the Federal Protective Service told KOIN-TV that though there was some screaming, "nothing was violent or anything like that" and it actually remained "very calm and peaceful."

Farther south, hundreds of people gathered in a protest at the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which organized the demonstration told Houston Public Media.

Meanwhile, first lady Melania Trump made another trip to the border Thursday to visit a temporary detention facility for children and adults in Arizona.

"I want to thank you for all your hard work that you do," she told Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. "And I know how dangerous and difficult your daily jobs are. I really appreciate all you do on behalf of the country ... I'm here to support you and give my help, whatever I can for behalf of the children and the families. Thank you for having me."

McAleenan said 1,100 unaccompanied children entered at the Arizona ports of entry since October 2017, including a 6-year-old boy left alone near Luke Air Force Base with a Coke bottle in hand.

"People have to understand the dangers of the desert, of the heat, of the violence that exists out there," McAleenan said. "This is something that our people encounter on a daily basis."

Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor under federal law, and for a person who has already been deported once it's a low-level felony, but the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy announced in April prosecutes both with no exceptions even if a person requests asylum.

Since the day he announced his presidential campaign, Trump has made securing the southern border a cornerstone of his presidency. He has used examples of violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrations to shore up support for a border wall and his zero-tolerance policies.

"I always hear that -- 'Oh no, the [undocumented immigration] population is safer than the people that live in the country.' You've heard that, fellows, right? And I say is that possible? The answer is it is not true. You hear like they are better people than what we have, than our citizens, it is not true," he said last week.

Trump signed an executive order last week to end the policy of separating immigrant children from their families after national outcry, replacing it with a policy of family detention. That left officials scrambling to figure out how to detain families together until Monday when border officials temporarily stopped referring most immigrant families for prosecution.

A federal judge in California ordered Tuesday that immigrant children separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexican border must be reunited within 30 days -- and children under 5 within 14 days based on an ACLU suit. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated more than 2,000 children were still in immigration detention centers separate from their parents, at that time.ARTICLE:Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Baby in Arms, Joins Immigration Protests on Capitol HillSen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), who recently gave birth, brought her infant daughter as she joined a large demonstration on Capitol Hill on Thursday targeting the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

The protesters were drawing attention to the separation of families seeking asylum at the southern border, a practice that was temporarily halted by an executive order from President Donald Trump.

“I could only imagine what it would be like to have my daughter—my breastfeeding child—ripped away from me the way some of these other moms’ babies have been,” Duckworth said, referring to the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which has led to the separation of immigrant families who illegally cross the southern border.

Other Democratic senators also attended the protest, including Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Ed Markey (D-MA).

Demonstrators were wearing foil to represent the foil-like sleeping bags that children inside the detention facilities were using.

“We have responsibilities under international treaties to treat people with respect when they seek asylum. We have national laws that require it,” Merkley told The Daily Beast.

The Oregon Democrat traveled to southern Texas recently to call attention to the Trump administration policy, which has spurred bipartisan opposition outrage but has yet to lead to a negotiated solution.

Trump’s executive order will likely be subject to legal challenges, and Senate Republicans are still cobbling together a proposal that would permanently end the separation of families while also increasing the number of immigration judges in order to expedite asylum cases. But that measure has yet to attract Democratic support, which is necessary in order to clear the 60-vote threshold. The House failed to pass two conservative immigration bills this week and last week that would have addressed the family-separation issue.

Capitol Police said 575 people were arrested from the Hart building for unlawfully demonstrating. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), a progressive who has been outspoken on immigration issues, was among those arrested. The protest took place in the atrium of the Hart Senate office building, where many senators’ personal offices are located.ARTICLE:Orlando International Airport to scan faces of US citizensORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida's busiest airport will be the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, officials said Thursday, a move that pleases airport executives but worries privacy advocates.

Officials at Orlando International Airport said the expansion of face scans would speed up the time it takes for passengers to go through customs.

"It's almost like Christmas in June for me," said Phil Brown, chief executive of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. "The process of going into and out of Orlando is going to be greatly enhanced."

But some privacy advocates say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don't involve all international flights at the airports as the program's expansion in Orlando would.

The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has passport images of people who should be on the flight in order to verify the traveler's identity. The images are held in the database for 14 days before being deleted, said John Wagner, an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The face scan expansion is costing the Orlando airport authority $4 million. The program should be rolled out at other airports in other U.S. cities in the next year, Wagner said.

"We're comparing you against a photograph you've given the U.S. government for the purposes of travel," Wagner said. "You know your picture is being taken. You're standing in front of a camera. There's nothing subversive about this, and we're only comparing you against your passport photo."

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency "doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

"We're not talking about one gate," he said. "We're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up."

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year. Face scans for arrivals and departures should be fully in place by the end of the year, although passengers landing at Orlando International Airport currently undergo them upon arriving. Passengers who had their photos taken Thursday at the Orlando airport took it in stride.

"It was fine, efficient, very fast," said Katrina Poulsen, a Denmark resident who arrived in Orlando on a flight from London.

Andrea Nabarria, who arrived on the same flight, said he understands the concerns about privacy but that passengers may have to give up something in exchange for beefed up security.

"At least that's what we're told," said Nabarria, an Italian who is a resident of Denmark.

Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans' accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Wagner said the agency hasn't seen discrepancies based on race or gender using face scans at the other airports.

Two U.S. senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

"It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport," said the letter from U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.ARTICLE:Lawmakers demand secret VA nursing home data be released after USA TODAY, Boston Globe reportCLOSE Don Ruch’s family thought round-the-clock care would help him recuperate, but he ended up in intensive care in septic shock, suffering from “severe” malnutrition, bedsores on his pelvis and back, a burn on his right thigh and a trauma wound.

WASHINGTON – Several members of Congress demanded Tuesday that the Department of Veterans Affairs release a full complement of nursing home data that the agency has kept hidden from the public for years, citing a recent USA TODAY and Boston Globe investigation into the state of care at VA facilities.

The VA pushed back Tuesday on the report, which was based on the agency’s own internal documents and facility ratings, by downplaying the findings and calling the story “fake news.”

The internal documents show that care at the VA’s 133 nursing homes scored worse on average than private sector homes on key quality indicators, including rates of anti-psychotic drug prescription and residents’ deterioration.

Following inquiries from USA TODAY and the Globe, the VA last week released some of its nursing home ratings, but not the underlying quality data, such as rates of infection and injury. The agency has tracked this information for years, but kept it from public view.

“Widespread underperformance at VA nursing homes is a betrayal of veterans’ trust and wellbeing,” said Minnesota Rep. Tim Walz, the highest ranking Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. “VA concealing this data from the public until news stories were about to be filed makes matters infinitely worse and is nothing more than fake transparency.

“Veterans and their loved ones deserve real accountability and transparency at VA, and that is why I am calling on VA to make all nursing home data, especially key quality indicators such as rates of injury and infection, available to the public immediately.”

Both the Republican-led House and Senate VA committees requested briefings from VA officials following the report. Those meetings are scheduled later this week, spokespeople for the committees said.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour, meanwhile, took to Twitter to claim that prior to Trump’s presidency, “you haven't seen this much VA transparency or accountability,” and call the story about the secret nursing home data “the definition of fake news.”

Cashour on Tuesday claimed the story painted “a misleading picture of how our facilities actually compare with the private sector.”

The ratings showed that as of March 31, nearly half of VA nursing homes – 58 – received the lowest rating for quality in the agency’s rankings of one out of five stars.

Cashour declined to answer questions about why the VA hasn’t released the underlying nursing home quality data, inspection reports, or staffing data.

He asserted that “overall,” the VA nursing home system “compares closely” with the private sector. But he said VA nursing homes score lower on key quality indicators because veterans are typically sicker than residents of private facilities.

“Also, private sector nursing homes admit patients selectively, whereas – unlike the private sector – VA will not refuse service to any eligible veteran, no matter how challenging the veteran’s conditions are to treat,” Cashour said.

Lawmakers demanding the VA release all its nursing home data include Massachusetts Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, also Democrats.

The VA nursing home in Bedford, Massachusetts, was one of the worst in the country in the agency’s quality ratings last year receiving one out of five stars, in part for giving so many residents anti-psychotic drugs, according to internal VA documents.

“Veterans deserve the best healthcare in the world. Period. That means having more transparency than private providers, not less,” said Moulton, an Iraq veteran who receives healthcare at the Bedford VA. “The VA is doing many things well, but this is a clear example of where they are failing.”

The VA nursing home in Tuskegee, Alabama, also was among the worst in the country in the agency’s quality ratings last year, according to internal documents. Staff there lost track of Earl James Zook, 72, a dementia patient and known wander risk, who walked out a broken door on a secure ward in January 2017 and hasn’t been seen since. His wife of 38 years, Leslie Roe, had him declared dead earlier this year.

“This information is shocking,” Jones said. “And even more than that, it’s so sad that we continue to let down those men and women who have served us so well, and that we have made promises to take care of them, and we just continue to fail, and that is both sad and shocking.”

A bipartisan group of House members from Florida penned a letter to the VA Monday urging that care be improved at VA nursing homes in Tampa and Bay Pines, Fla., both one-star facilities in agency rankings. The lawmakers called the VA’s claim that veteran’s are sicker than private nursing home residents “simply insufficient.”

“We cannot tolerate sub-par quality of care for Veterans who have sacrificed so much,” wrote Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis and Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Charlie Crist. “They have earned the best we can offer.”

Cashour, the VA spokesman, said “VA appreciates the lawmakers’ concerns and will respond to them directly.”

Conservative advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, which has generally been supportive of VA leadership under Trump, echoed lawmakers who said VA needs to open the books on its nursing homes.

“The more data that the VA can share, the better, because ultimately, at the end of the day, it helps veterans,” Dan Caldwell, executive director of the group, said in an interview. “It helps veterans determine whether or not they are getting the quality of care that they deserve.”

Tammy Duckworth visited female activists in a Capitol Hill Senate building who are protesting the administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy

“I wanted to show my support for the folks here today,” Duckworth, who gave birth to her second child in April, told CNN in an interview after she visited with protesters. “I could only imagine what it would be like to have my daughter — my breastfeeding child — ripped away from me the way some of these other moms’ babies have been.”

More than 1,000 female activists marched through Washington Thursday to protest the separation of children from their immigration parents at the US-Mexico border.

US Capitol Police arrested approximately 575 individuals with unlawfully demonstrating, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington.

The arrests have been peaceful so far, with the protesters not arguing with Capitol police officers during arrests and no cuffs being put on them.

Other Democratic senators — including Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — also visited the protesters to support their efforts.

The protestors chanted “abolish ICE” as well as “where are the children?” as well as other chants that are hard to hear within the building.

The activists sat on the floor of the Senate building with emergency blankets to demand Congress act to end the Trump administration policies that criminalize and detain undocumented immigrants and separates their children from them.

Congress is set to leave town for a week-long recess without passing any legislation to address the situation at the US border. On Wednesday, the House failed to pass legislation that would have address in part several high-profile immigration-related policies including border wall funding and an eventual pathway to citizenship for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

In an executive order last week, President Donald Trump said his administration was seeking more authority to detain families together until the end of their immigration proceedings.

The order instructs federal agencies — notably the Department of Defense — to prepare facilities to house the potentially thousands of families who will be detained.ARTICLE:Face scans for international travelers at Florida airportOrlando International Airport to scan faces of US citizens

The move represents an expansion of a Customs and Border Protection experimental program that already placed cameras at 13 airports to screen passengers leaving the country or returning from overseas.

The verification process, where a camera scans the traveler’s face to compare it to Department of Homeland Security travel databases, takes less than 2 seconds and has a 99 percent match rate, according to CBP.

“We are at a critical turning point in the implementation of a biometric entry-exit system, and we’ve found a path forward that transforms travel for all travelers,” CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said.

The goal is to electronically screen passengers quickly and efficiently. One advantage is that the cameras are small and easy to install.

But privacy advocates question how the images will be used and how a traveler will be treated if rejected by the equipment.

"It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport," said the letter from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Mike Lee, R-Utah.

CBP said it is committed to its privacy obligations and has taken steps to safeguard the privacy of all travelers, limiting the amount of personally identifiable information used.

Phil Brown, CEO of the Greater Orlando Airport Authority, said the technology is part of a premier travel experience for 5 million international visitors per year.

“By incorporating biometric technology into our entry and exit processes, safety, security and speed are optimized so customers can enjoy a more streamlined and comfortable journey through Florida’s busiest airport,” Brown said.

Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, called the program a great step in making travel more efficient in the country’s most-visited travel region.

"Passengers traveling to and from Orlando will immediately enjoy a more efficient screening process and shorter wait times. This is also a win for our national security, as it provides an accurate way to identify individuals while combatting the use of falsified documents.

Other U.S. airports where CBP has facial-recognition equipment are Miami, Atlanta, New York JFK, San Diego, Houston Intercontinental and Hobby, Washington Dulles, Las Vegas and Chicago O’Hare.

The equipment is also at Preclearance airports overseas, where travelers clear customs and immigration before getting on the plane, in Aruba, Abu Dhabi and Ireland’s Shannon and Dublin airports.

CBP has partnerships with Delta Air Lines, Jet Blue Airways, British Airways, Lufthansa and Air New Zealand to advance biometric exit.

More than a thousand female protesters, joined by Democratic senators, marched two miles down Pennsylvania Avenue to protest the Trump Administration's family detention and separation policies, and demanded the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ABC reports. The walk ended in the Hart Senate building, where Capitol Police arrested many of them in response to an act of civil disobedience.

Chanting "WE CARE" and "ABOLISH ICE," the protesters are demanding Congress act to end Trump's policies that criminalize and detain undocumented immigrants and separate detained families. ICE is a common acronym for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Women's March organizers were involved in today's action, along with local D.C. advocacy groups. The rally started in Freedom Plaza at around 11 a.m and proceeded down Pennsylvania Avenue until participants reached the Capitol. Once they reached the building, women sat on the ground and waited to be carted off. Police began arresting them in groups.

"We are here to say we’re ready to sacrifice and we’re ready to leave our jobs, leave our families to come and take this act of civil disobedience here,” she said.

The actress Susan Sarandon made an appearance at the march, and she was arrested in the second group of protesters in the Hart Building, where 50 senators have their offices, according to Washington Post reporter Marissa Lang.

The march began near the Department of Justice, where speakers rallied supporters by sharing their experiences with immigration and calling for action. Before the march, protesters were split into four groups to review the procedures if arrested.

Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas called for ongoing mobilization beyond Thursday's protest. “This is not a day event,” Lee told a crowd of protesters. “This is an everyday event.”

People showed their support through handmade signs, including one that read “Don’t have a heart of I.C.E.” Others marked “We Care” on their palms. Still other protesters wore jackets with “I really care. Do you?” painted in white on their backs, a reaction to the controversy that followed First Lady Melania Trump’s trip to the southwest to visit detained children. As she boarded a plane in Washington D.C, photographers could clearly read the message "I really don't care. Do u?" on the back of her jacket, which reportedly retails from Zara for $39. While the First Lady took the jacket off before exiting the plane, it was widely seen as an inappropriate choice of clothing.

TAG, YOU’RE IT: The Senate Commerce Committee approved Heidi King's nomination to lead NHTSA on a razor-thin, party-line vote Wednesday after it was initially scuttled last month due to fears of low Republican attendance. Ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said he was voting no because King "lacks the fire in the belly to protect consumers from something which is killing" people — meaning, defective Takata airbags. Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters afterward he thought the unanimous Democratic opposition was “driven by Nelson” and that other Democrats “fell in line behind him.” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), though, cited a different reason for voting no: fuel economy standards, which he said King wants to roll back.

Story Continued Below

What’s next: King could be the next nominee to sit in the purgatory that's plaguing FTA nominee Thelma Drake — committee-approved but awaiting a vote by the full Senate. Calendar issues are undoubtedly a factor, but Democratic opposition could continue to dog King. No senator has yet copped to putting a hold on her confirmation on the floor, but we’ll be polling members to find out what’s in store.

FINANCE TO KEEP LOW PROFILE ON FAA BILL: The Senate Finance Committee could hold a markup of its own on the FAA bill’s tax title, but it probably won’t — at least according to a Commerce Committee staffer on Wednesday. He said Finance will probably bring its tax title as an amendment once the bill hits the floor. Commerce leaders are hotlining the FAA bill (S. 1405 (115)) to clear up any issues that could bog down passage and squeeze it into as little time as possible on the Senate floor.

Note: Now that the Senate’s top priority is confirming a new Supreme Court justice before the midterms, floor time is at an all-time premium.

NOT-SO-HAPPY ANNIVERSARY: Wednesday marked one year since the House Energy and Commerce Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee held the first hearing on its self-driving car bill (H.R. 3388 (115)), which the full committee unanimously approved and then sailed through a voice vote on the House floor — only to be met with months of stagnation in the Senate. “We’re running out of time,” Subcommittee Chairman Bob Latta (R-Ohio) told our Tanya Snyder. “I’m very concerned that if we don’t get this done, we’ll have this patchwork [of state regulations] and we’re going to have companies from other countries developing this technology and it won’t be here.” He also said the uptick in traffic deaths compels them to act.

Kick in the pants: “You look at an industry that’s just a hair under a trillion dollars, we move a piece of legislation of this magnitude out with bipartisanship with a unanimous vote, I think that speaks volumes,” Latta said. He and ranking member Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) wrote an op-ed recently and have put out several press releases as the anniversary approached urging the Senate to act.

SETTING THEIR SIGHTS A LITTLE LOWER: Safety groups have pressed the Senate Commerce Committee to include semi-autonomous vehicles in its driverless car bill, and it seems they’re listening. Staffers, if not members, are discussing the inclusion of Level 2 vehicles in the bill — which can steer, accelerate and brake themselves but leave drivers to do the more sophisticated tasks — in the wake of high-profile crashes involving Tesla’s Autopilot. In both of those crashes, the people behind the wheel apparently overestimated the car's abilities and failed to take over the controls when prompted. Tanya has more for Pros.

SECURITY BILLS CLEAR COMMITTEE: The Senate Commerce Committee approved several transportation security bills by voice vote Wednesday. One (S. 3094 (115)) would specify that the Coast Guard can only require the use of biometric readers for transportation worker ID cards after it submits an assessment of the program. Another bill (H.R. 4467 (115)) would require the Federal Air Marshal Service to use risk-based strategies when allocating resources for international and domestic flight coverage. And another (H.R. 4559 (115)) would direct TSA to review improving global aviation security standards, including cybersecurity standards, across the global aviation system.

SUMMER, SUMMER, SUMMER TIME: TSA expects to see a surge in airport travel volumes in the lead up to the July Fourth holiday, agency chief David Pekoske told reporters Wednesday. He said 2.6 million travelers are expected to go through security checkpoints this Friday alone. “We expect that this coming Friday will potentially be one of the busiest days ever in TSA history in terms of passenger throughput,” he said. The spike will occur as the agency also works with international airports to implement new rules requiring additional screening of powders in carry-on bags, starting on Saturday. The procedures, which include asking passengers to remove food items and other clutter from bags, are already in effect domestically.

The impact: Pekoske said during normal travel periods, the majority of PreCheck passengers get through checkpoints within 10 minutes and the bulk of regular travelers typically wait no more than 20 minutes. But it can increase to 45 or 60 minutes when lanes are pushed to capacity, he said. He advised travelers to arrive early.

More ch-ch-changes: Pekoske also noted that an interim final rule from TSA and Customs and Border Protection that requires advanced screening of all air cargo entering the U.S. went into effect earlier this month. The new policy “allows us to do a process quite similar actually to what we do with passengers when passengers buy a ticket,” he said. “[W]e check passengers against our databases and assign risk based on those results. We’re doing the very same thing for cargo.”

The land of tomorrow: TSA and CBP also are in discussions about merging PreCheck and Global Entry and streamlining enrollment for “trusted travelers,” Pekoske said. But he added that the process could take a year or more to complete.

LET ME EXPLAIN: Delta Air Lines caught some flak last week for not pressing the Trump administration to avoid using its planes to carry separated migrant children — which set Delta apart from American, United and other airlines. Delta did release a statement after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on the matter, saying: “Recent reports of families being separated are disheartening and do not align with Delta’s core values.” Defending his company Wednesday during a National Press Club event, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said that “many of the actions that were interpreted as separating” families at the time were actually actions to fly “kids to reunite [them] with families.” He added that “the story got out before the facts got out,” and Delta wanted to “understand the facts” before making a statement.

THE ‘NANNY DOGS’: A pit bull owner has launched a petition on the Care2 website against Delta’s impending restrictions on service animals, including a ban on pit bulls and "bully" breeds. “As more people become aware that we should be blaming the deed, not the breed, the trend worldwide has been to end bans against certain dogs,” Kelsey Bourgeois, the author of the petition, said. “Apparently Delta did not get the memo.” Delta is one of several airlines implementing new rules in the wake of what it says has been an uptick in animal-related attacks and other incidents on flights. Delta’s new service animal rules go into effect July 10. The petition currently has more than 26,000 signatures.

STATE OF AIR TRAVEL: A new Morning Consult travel report shows that the majority of Americans still prefer to get around in their cars, but when they do choose to fly, most consider Southwest, American, Delta and United to be the top choices. And Southwest enjoys the most favorable opinions, overall. Other findings of note were that 74 percent of people polled considered ticket cost the most important factor when mulling air travel and also that costs for premium services outweighed airline preferences when it came to choosing a carrier.

IF WE HAD IT OUR WAY: The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a far-reaching proposal to reorganize the federal government, with four pages dedicated to our favorite department. The document makes clear that the administration still wants air traffic control operations taken out of the FAA, even though President Donald Trump abandoned a bill from House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster that would’ve done that. “It had a chance five months ago. I’ve passed an FAA bill and had to take out privatization,” Shuster told CQ’s Jacob Fischler. “[The bill] passed the House and the Senate’s not going to do it. So five months too late. Great idea.”

The administration also proposes:

— Giving DOT responsibility over commercial navigation instead of the Army Corp of Engineers.

— Transferring Saint Lawrence Seaway lock operations outside the government.

— Designating DOT as in charge of “permitting alterations to bridges and aids to coastal navigation” instead of the Coast Guard.

— Putting transit security grants under FTA instead of FEMA, and surface transportation security programs under DOT instead of TSA.

— Studying whether the “organizational design” of the DOT Office of the Secretary “is optimal for allowing it to most effectively carry out its statutory responsibilities.”

HOLD UP: The Coast Guard is proposing to delay implementation of its rule requiring cargo facilities to install biometric readers to verify transportation workers' ID cards. The final rule was scheduled to go into effect on Aug. 23, but the Coast Guard wants to extend the deadline for compliance by three years for certain facilities. Both lawmakers and industry groups have criticized the service’s rollout of the rule, saying that it has not provided enough guidance on how to meet the requirements. The Senate Commerce Committee announced Thursday that it planned to mark up a bill next week, S. 3094 (115), that would mandate a full delay of the rule until the Coast Guard submits a report assessing the need for biometric card readers. The House Homeland Security Committee approved a similar measure earlier this month.

Close, but no cigar: The American Chemistry Council, which supports both bills, said the Coast Guard proposal doesn’t go far enough. “It does not extend the deadline for all facilities, just for some,” ACC spokesman Scott Jensen told MT. “So there will be still a number of facilities that need to meet the August deadline.” Given that, he said congressional action is still necessary. ACC is one of three groups that filed a lawsuit against the Coast Guard in April over the requirement. The International Liquid Terminals Association and the Fertilizer Institute are the other two plaintiffs.

SENATE PANEL OKs DHS SPENDING BILL: Senate appropriators quickly approved a $55 billion fiscal year 2019 spending bill for DHS on Thursday. The legislation would help TSA and Customs staff up and help the Coast Guard pay for a long-sought new heavy polar icebreaker, among other items. Here’s our rundown of some of the top items from earlier this week.

TIGHTEN UP: Four House Democrats think FRA’s exemptions from the positive train control mandate are “overly broad,” allowing railroads to get out of installing the technology by, say, cutting service. “We strongly urge FRA to revise its regulations to tighten PTC exemptions and focus on ways to help railroads comply with the law rather than circumvent it through regulatory carve-outs,” Reps. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Mike Capuano (D-Mass.), Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) wrote in a letter to FRA Administrator Ron Batory. Brianna has more for Pros.

READY FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP? Passengers flying into or out of Orlando International Airport will soon have to get their faces scanned. For now, U.S. citizens can opt out, though privacy watchdogs worry that passengers aren’t made aware of their right to do so, the AP reports. Eight of the nation’s busiest airports already use face-scan technology on a more limited basis.

Quicker to the gate: The U.S. Travel Association hailed the move, with President and CEO Roger Dow saying it would make travel more efficient and shorten wait times. "The U.S. travel community is hopeful that biometric entry and exit systems will soon be implemented in airports nationwide,” he said.

KING UP TO BAT: Heidi King will finally get a vote on her nomination to head NHTSA in the Senate Commerce Committee next week. After a May 22 vote was scuttled due to low Republican attendance (and Democratic opposition), the committee is now planning to take up King’s nomination on Wednesday. Democrats are still likely to oppose her confirmation, dismayed at the pace of rulemaking and the wishy-washy answers she gave on climate change, among others. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) have not yet gotten a response to their letter urging King to investigate and initiate a long-overdue rulemaking on keyless ignition safety. Check out King’s responses to Republican questions from her confirmation hearing here and to top committee Democrat Bill Nelson’s questions here.

OUSTED: Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was forced to resign Thursday after violating the company’s prohibition on managers having romantic relationships with employees. Krzanich chaired the Drone Advisory Committee and held to the philosophy that “the future of drones is more about what you can do with that data … than the actual flight itself,” as he said at a drone event last fall. "Data is the new oil.”

GROUP PUSHES SENATE PROBE OF MCCASKILL: A conservative watchdog group is calling for a Senate ethics investigation into Sen. Claire McCaskill’s use of a private plane owned by her husband during her campaign travels, POLITICO’s Elana Schor reports. “The ethics investigation request, filed by the right-leaning Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, or FACT, cites McCaskill’s 2017 Senate financial disclosure, which reported between $0 and $201 of income from the plane owned by her husband’s company.” McCaskill, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, is in a competitive midterm race with Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley.

CAUTION: DRIVER (ASSIST) IN TRAINING: An automated car demonstration on Capitol Hill on Thursday, hosted by Consumer Reports, had a somewhat different angle than industry-sponsored demonstrations in the past. The group showcased both the benefits and limitations of the cars’ advanced driver-assist systems and discussed why some of the technologies should be mandated for all new cars. Consumer Reports also said Senate legislation on automated vehicles is dangerously insufficient. Consumer Reports engineers piloting the cars, for example, made sure to let riders know that the cars would go through stop signs and red lights if human drivers didn’t brake. The cars that were showcased are considered Level 2 vehicles, which are not covered by the bill currently languishing in the Senate.

SLICE OF PI: “Steven Akey, vice president of government affairs for Bridgestone Americas, will retire at the end of the month. In an interview with [POLITICO Influence], Akey said his decision to retire was part of a pact he made with his wife. Prior to moving to the private sector, Akey was director of public affairs at the Department of Transportation under President Bill Clinton. He told PI that his background in transportation led him to the tire industry. Among the most pressing issues facing the tire industry is the ‘rapidly changing landscape of technology’ as well as the rise in ride-sharing. ‘If you think of ride-sharing, you think of those vehicles being used much more than the car I drive to and from work,’ Akey said. ‘You've got to figure out how to best compete in that space.’ In addition to his work at Bridgestone Americas, Akey was a board member and on several committees for the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association.”

The Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee pressured Chad McIntosh and Peter Wright to buck what they see as patterns Pruitt has put into practice of violating ethics and spending standards and aggressively rolling back regulations on climate and other matters.

McIntosh, Ford Motor Co.’s environmental policy chief, was tapped to lead the EPA’s international and tribal affairs office. Wright, a senior attorney at DowDuPont, would lead the office of land and emergency management, which oversees chemical plant safety rules, Superfund site cleanups and other areas.

“I have no expectation that would happen, but I wouldn’t agree to it,” Wright responded.

McIntosh promised to be “in full compliance with the all the rules and regulations of the agency and work very closely with the ethics officials on all issues.”

A similar script played out when Carper and his colleagues asked the nominees about doing personal tasks for Pruitt, doing favors for his political allies, asking staffers to find reasons to visit certain international destinations and other questions.

Democrats also used the opportunity to push back on Pruitt’s skepticism of climate change science.

But the nominees only said that humans play some role, not whether humans play the primary role.

“I’m not detailedly familiar with the science to put a relative weight, but I believe they are a cause,” Wright said.

Wright agreed, however, that future predictions about climate impacts like severe weather and flooding ought to play into how the EPA directs Superfund cleanups.

Wright early on in the hearing diffused one of Democrats’ top concerns: that he would be overseeing cleanups of dozens Superfund sites for which his previous employer is responsible.

He said he has already worked with ethics officials to plan out how he would be recused from matters pertaining to those sites or any other matters related to Dow or DuPont.ARTICLE:Nordkorea udbygger angiveligt atomanlægARTICLE:Nordkorea udbygger angiveligt atomanlæg, viser nye satellitbillederARTICLE:Face scans for international travelers at Florida airportORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Florida's busiest airport will be the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, officials said Thursday, a move that pleases airport executives but worries privacy advocates.

Officials at Orlando International Airport said the expansion of face scans would speed up the time it takes for passengers to go through customs.

"It's almost like Christmas in June for me," said Phil Brown, chief executive of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. "The process of going into and out of Orlando is going to be greatly enhanced."

But some privacy advocates say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don't involve all international flights at the airports as the program's expansion in Orlando would.

The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has passport images of people who should be on the flight in order to verify the traveler's identity. The images are held in the database for 14 days before being deleted, said John Wagner, an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The face scan expansion is costing the Orlando airport authority $4 million. The program should be rolled out at other airports in other U.S. cities in the next year, Wagner said.

"We're comparing you against a photograph you've given the U.S. government for the purposes of travel," Wagner said. "You know your picture is being taken. You're standing in front of a camera. There's nothing subversive about this, and we're only comparing you against your passport photo."

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency "doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

"We're not talking about one gate," he said. "We're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up."

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year. Face scans for arrivals and departures should be fully in place by the end of the year, although passengers landing at Orlando International Airport currently undergo them upon arriving. Passengers who had their photos taken Thursday at the Orlando airport took it in stride.

"It was fine, efficient, very fast," said Katrina Poulsen, a Denmark resident who arrived in Orlando on a flight from London.

Andrea Nabarria, who arrived on the same flight, said he understands the concerns about privacy but that passengers may have to give up something in exchange for beefed up security.

"At least that's what we're told," said Nabarria, an Italian who is a resident of Denmark.

Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans' accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Wagner said the agency hasn't seen discrepancies based on race or gender using face scans at the other airports.

Two U.S. senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

"It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport," said the letter from U.S. Sen.

Douze sénateurs démocrates et Sanders, un indépendant qui s’est présenté à la nomination du Parti Démocrate pour les élections présidentielles en 2016, ont signé la lettre datée du 11 mai qui a été envoyée au Secrétaire de la Défense Mike Pompeo. Elle disait également que l’administration Trump devrait inciter Israël à limiter les restrictions sur les Palestiniens vivant à Gaza.

Saban a envoyé des courriels à six sénateurs, avec une poignée de membres du personnel pour d’autres, exprimant ainsi son « désarroi » devant leur signature de la lettre, a annoncé mercredi Intercept.

La lettre de Sanders a été envoyée alors que des milliers de Palestiniens ont participé à des affrontements à la frontière entre Israël et Gaza. Plus de 100 Palestiniens ont été tués par des soldats israéliens dans les deux mois de manifestations, dont de nombreux étaient des membres du groupe terroriste du Hamas.

« Sénateurs, le fait que vous écoutiez le Sénateur Sanders et accusiez Israël d’être le coupable principal est scandaleux, mal informé et blessant et cela témoigne d’une manque de compréhension des éléments basiques de la région, a écrit Saban dans son email. Faites vos devoirs à la maison, à moins que vous n’ayez décidé de suivre aveuglément la voie simpliste, ignorante, mal informée et mal conseillée du Sénateur Sanders ».

Israël n’a été accusé nulle part, dans la lettre de Sanders, d’être le « coupable principal » de la situation humanitaire à Gaza, comme Saban l’a indiqué. Tout en répartissant la responsabilité aussi avec le Hamas, Sanders a écrit que le « contrôle continu [d’Israël] de l’espace aérien et maritime, aux frontières nord, sud et est, et les restrictions sur la liberté de mouvement des personnes, des produits et des équipements nécessaires qui peuvent entrer et sortir de Gaza, ont empiré la situation humanitaire à Gaza ».

Israël maintient que le blocus et les restrictions sont nécessaires pour empêcher le Hamas, le groupe terroriste qui contrôle Gaza et qui vise à la destruction de l’état juif, d’obtenir des armes qui pourraient être utilisées pour mener des attaques contre Israël.

Les sénateurs démocrates, qui ont signé la lettre, étaient Dianne Feinstein de Californie, Patrick Leahy de Vermont, Tom Carper de Delaware, Sherrod Brown de l’Ohio, Chris Van Hollen du Maryland, Elizabeth Warren du Massachusetts, Martin Heinrich du Nouveau Mexique, Jeff Merkley de l’Oregon, Tom Udall du Nouveau Mexique, Sheldon Whitehouse et Jack Reed deRhode Island, tout comme Ed Markey du Massachusetts.

Saban, âgé de 73 ans, a versé des millions de dollars aux Démocrates, au fil des années, y compris 15 millions de dollars pour la campagne présidentielle ratée d’Hillary Clinton. Il a aussi donné à des causes liées à Israël, notamment le Forum Saban annuel en Israël, qui rassemble des dirigeants politiques des Etats-Unis et d’Israël pour discuter des sujets liés à l’état juif, et le conseil israélo-américain, qui cherche à renforcer l’identité israélienne et juive des Israéliens vivant aux Etats-Unis.ARTICLE:OCR wins HIPAA caseOCR wins HIPAA case

OCR WINS HIPAA CASE: The MD Anderson Cancer Center must pay $4.3 million in fines stemming from insufficient privacy practices, in a victory for the HHS Office for Civil Rights, Morning eHealth’s Darius Tahir reports.

Story Continued Below

The judgement announced Monday involved the disclosure of more than 30,000 patients' protected information, which MD Anderson did not encrypt, leading to OCR's complaint. An administrative law judge affirmed OCR's contention that the cancer center should have encrypted thumb drives containing patient information.

MD Anderson didn't dispute OCR's version of events, but said that it was not obligated to encrypt the data which was for research purposes. The argument led to a rare hearing before an administrative judge, who sided with OCR and blistered the cancer center for its "half-hearted" security practices and "fanciful" legal defenses seeking to evade punishment under HIPAA. Pros can read the rest of the story from Darius here.

“If the size of the fine has the desired sentinel effect, security in healthcare will improve,” Lucia Savage, chief privacy officer at Omada Health and formerly at ONC, tells Morning eHealth.

“In 2013, encryption was expensive and hard. Now, it is actually pretty easy, and there is a declining universe of reasons, if any, NOT to encrypt at rest."

HHS FINALIZES COMMON RULE DELAY: Researchers will not have to comply with changes to regulations surrounding research on human subjects until January 2019, per a final rule HHS published yesterday. Revisions to the so-called Common Rule would simplify the process by which researchers obtain consent from research subjects to use their data and biospecimens.

Despite several delays, the final rule provides a concrete compliance timeline for researchers, and groups including the American Medical Informatics Association were generally supportive.

“While the numerous delays to this rule’s implementation have been frustrating, we see this decision as an important assurance that much-needed updates to human subjects research will enable more data-driven research to the benefit of participants, patients, and the national research community,” the group said.

APPLE TO HELP 911 EMERGENCY SERVICES FIND IPHONE USERS: Apple is embarking on a partnership that would help 911 call centers and emergency services locate callers, POLITICO’s John Hendel reports.

Apple’s partnership with RapidSOS will begin later this year. Users with devices running iOS 12 will automatically be signed up but can opt out of the feature, which sends their location data securely to the relevant 911 call center. RapidSOS is backed by three former FCC chairmen and uses IP-based location data.

“Policymakers have long sought to provide first responders the ability to locate a person in distress while receiving rich data about his or her condition,” says Morgan Reed, president of ACT| The App Association, of which RapidSOS is a member. The partnership is a “key step” in realizing that vision.

RapidSOS is backed by former FCC chairmen Tom Wheeler, Julius Genachowski and Dennis Patrick, who also serve as advisers to the company. Pros can read the rest of John’s story here.

APPLE ANTITRUST CASE HEADS TO THE SUPREME COURT: The Cupertino tech giant has scored points with patient advocates by opening patient record data up to developers through its new Health Records API. But it still holds tight control over its app store, approving each app sold there and taking a cut for each download.

The Supreme Court plans to review a consumer-led class-action lawsuit that challenges Apple’s app practices, alleging monopoly pricing on the company's App Store, it said Monday.

Apple Inc. v. Pepper centers on the idea that the smartphone maker has monopolistic control over its app store, POLITICO’s Steven Overly writes. The Supreme Court must address the larger question of whether a third-party distributor like Apple can be sued by consumers, even if the exact prices they pay are determined by an outside seller.

Apple contends that it charges a commission to the app creator, not the consumer, and thus cannot be held accountable for setting prices. Both Apple and the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to look at the case. If Apple loses, it could set a broader precedent for e-commerce marketplaces that sell and distribute products whose prices are determined by third parties.

SENATE DEMS CALL FOR IG INVESTIGATION AT VA: Lawmakers are looking for more information about the implementation of a law that would make it easier to terminate VA employees. In a recent letter to the VA’s Office of the Inspector General, Sens. Jon Tester, Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, and Sherrod Brown said the Department has failed to supply relevant employment data to Congress though it has acquired and installed the software that would gather such data. They urged the IG to review the VA’s implementation of that law, known as the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.

… Meanwhile, nearly half of the VA’s nursing homes received VA’s lowest ranking of one out of five stars, according to reports Monday — data that VA purposefully sought to keep from the public, per USA Today.

GOOGLE USING AI TO PREDICT PATIENT DEATH: Google’s “Medical Brain” team is doing more than just creating a futuristic clinical experience involving elements of voice recognition and artificial intelligence. It’s also looking to predict exactly when patients will die, Bloomberg reports. The company’s algorithms analyze large amounts of patient data including notes from old charts to assign a numerical value to their death risk. It’s still early stage, executives say, and Google is still figuring out how to integrate the technology into clinics.

ON THE HILL: Sen. Ed Markey’s policy director plugged legislation that would incorporate more data into opioid response at a Hill briefing Monday hosted by the American Institutes for Research. Markey, along with Sens.

On Tuesday, the House Rules Committee meets at 5 p.m. to formulate rules on several bills including the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act, which would allow providers to access patient’s substance abuse history in health records.

(AP) — Florida’s busiest airport will be the first in the nation to require a face scan of passengers on all arriving and departing international flights, officials said Thursday, a move that pleases airport executives but worries privacy advocates.

Officials at Orlando International Airport said the expansion of face scans would speed up the time it takes for passengers to go through customs.

“It’s almost like Christmas in June for me,” said Phil Brown, chief executive of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. “The process of going into and out of Orlando is going to be greatly enhanced.”

But some privacy advocates say there are no formal rules in place for handling data gleaned from the scans, nor formal guidelines on what should happen if a passenger is wrongly prevented from boarding.

Airports in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington already use face scans for some departing international flights, but they don’t involve all international flights at the airports as the program’s expansion in Orlando would.

The image from the face scan is compared to a Department of Homeland Security biometric database that has passport images of people who should be on the flight in order to verify the traveler’s identity. The images are held in the database for 14 days before being deleted, said John Wagner, an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The face scan expansion is costing the Orlando airport authority $4 million. The program should be rolled out at other airports in other U.S. cities in the next year, Wagner said.

“We’re comparing you against a photograph you’ve given the U.S. government for the purposes of travel,” Wagner said. “You know your picture is being taken. You’re standing in front of a camera. There’s nothing subversive about this, and we’re only comparing you against your passport photo.”

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency “doesn’t seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out,” said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

The Orlando announcement marks a step up in the scope of the face scan program, Rudolph said.

“We’re not talking about one gate,” he said. “We’re talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up.”

Orlando International Airport had about 6 million international passengers in the past year. Face scans for arrivals and departures should be fully in place by the end of the year, although passengers landing at Orlando International Airport currently undergo them upon arriving. Passengers who had their photos taken Thursday at the Orlando airport took it in stride.

“It was fine, efficient, very fast,” said Katrina Poulsen, a Denmark resident who arrived in Orlando on a flight from London.

Andrea Nabarria, who arrived on the same flight, said he understands the concerns about privacy but that passengers may have to give up something in exchange for beefed up security.

“At least that’s what we’re told,” said Nabarria, an Italian who is a resident of Denmark.

Rudolph said he has concerns about the face scans’ accuracy, since some research shows they are less accurate with racial minorities, women and children. Researchers say this is because photos used to train the face-scanning software underrepresent minorities, women and young people.

Wagner said the agency hasn’t seen discrepancies based on race or gender using face scans at the other airports.

Two U.S. senators last month sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, which is home to the border protection agency, urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

“It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport,” said the letter from U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.ARTICLE:Face scans for international travelers at Florida airportOrlando International Airport to scan faces of US citizens

This story was originally published by HuffPost and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In proclaiming June National Ocean Month, President Donald Trump called on the nation to “reflect on the value and importance of oceans” and “celebrate this immense natural resource.”

But this week, in the midst of that celebration, he signed an executive order to revoke Obama-era protections for US oceans, coastlines and Great Lakes waters. Trump’s directive focuses on energy extraction, fishing, trade and national security, further highlighting that he believes that the greatest value of federal lands and waters lies in the commodities that can be harvested from them.

“Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy,” reads the order, which Trump signed Tuesday. “Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nation’s security and reduces reliance on imported energy.”

Missing from the order are words like “conservation,” “stewardship” and “climate change,” as well as any mention of numerous other threats facing the world’s oceans, including plastic pollution, coral bleaching and acidification. “Every decision involving the ocean also affects fish, wildlife and water quality with resulting costs or benefits for coastal communities, fisheries and tourism.”

Signed in 2010 in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and oil spill, Barack Obama’s executive order established a federal policy for protecting, maintaining and restoring ocean health and biodiversity.

“America’s stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and national and homeland security,” the Obama order states.

While the fishing and offshore energy industries celebrated Trump’s rollback, environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers were quick to blast the move.

Jacqueline Savitz, the chief policy officer for the nonprofit group Oceana, said the new order “undercuts important conservation measures needed to support strong coastal economies.”

“Every decision involving the ocean also affects fish, wildlife and water quality with resulting costs or benefits for coastal communities, fisheries and tourism,” she said in a statement. “We need strong national policies to help restore our fisheries and protect our oceans.”ARTICLE:Haim Saban criticizes Democrats for signing Bernie Sanders letter on Gaza crisisIsraeli-American entertainment mogul Haim Saban took several Democratic senators to task for signing on to a letter organized by Senator Bernie Sanders that calls on the US to âact urgently in order to help relieve the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.â

Twelve Democratic senators and Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic Partyâs nomination for president in 2016, signed the letter dated May 11 that was sent to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It also said the Trump administration should encourage Israel to ease restrictions on Palestinians living in Gaza.

Saban sent emails to six of the senators, along with a handful of staffers for others, expressing his âdismayâ that they signed the letter, The Intercept reported Wednesday.

The Sanders letter was sent as thousands of Palestinians participated in clashes on the border between Israel and Gaza. More than 100 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis soldiers in the two months of protests, many of whom were members of the Hamas terrorist group.

âSenators, for you to listen to Senator Sanders and accuse Israel of being the main culprit is outrageous, misinformed, offensive and shows a lack of understanding of the regionâs basic fundamentals,â Saban wrote in the email. âDo your homework, unless you have chosen to blindly follow Senator Sandersâ ill advised, misinformed, simplistic, and ignorant lead.â

Nowhere in the Sanders letter was Israel accused of being the âmain culpritâ of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, as Saban indicated. While apportioning blame with Hamas, Sanders wrote Israel’s “continuing control of Gaza’s air, sea and northern, southern and eastern borders, and its restrictions on the freedom of movement of people, legitimate goods and equipment in and out of Gaza, have made the humanitarian situation worse.”

Israel maintains the blockade and restrictions are necessary to prevent Hamas, the terror group that rules Gaza and is committed to the Jewish state’s destruction, from acquiring weapons that could be used to carry out attacks against Israel.

The Democratic senators who signed the letter were Dianne Feinstein of California, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Tom Carper of Delaware, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tom Udall of New Mexico, Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, as well as Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

Saban, 73, has poured millions into Democratic politics over the years, including $15 million to Hillary Clintonâs failed presidential campaign. He also donates to causes related to Israel, including the annual Saban Forum on Israel, which brings together political leaders from the United States and Israel to debate topics related to the Jewish state, and the Israeli-American Council, which aims to boost the Israeli and Jewish identity â and political clout â of Israelis living in the US.ARTICLE:Orlando airport to start scanning faces of US citizens on international flightsOrlando airport to start scanning faces of US citizens on international flights

The CRA lets Congress reverse a regulatory action with a simply majority vote in the Senate and the House (which is how the GOP successfully killed FCC privacy protections last year). And while the Senate voted 52 to 47 back in May to reverse the FCC's attack on net neutrality, companion efforts to set up a similar vote in the House don't appear to be gaining much traction as the clock continues to tick. A discharge petition needs 218 votes to even see floor time, and another 218 votes to pass the measure.

But so far, the petition only currently has 172 likely votes, all Democrats:

The House #NetNeutrality discharge petition is at 172 signatures. We’re 46 away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order. Has your representative signed the petition to #SaveTheInternet? Check here: https://t.co/zKI7sxSwGj — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) June 26, 2018

Again, not a single Republican in the House has signaled any interest in saving net neutrality. As we've long noted, the quest for a healthy internet free from anti-competitive meddling by telecom monopolies has long been idiotically framed as a partisan issue despite broad, bipartisan consumer support. ISPs and their numerous political proxy organizations have long enjoyed using rhetoric that only further fuels these divisions (derailing real consensus) by conflating meaningful consumer protections with a "government takeover of the internet," ideas that are happily parroted by many ISP cash-loving DC lawmakers.

Undaunted, net neutrality activists held an advocacy day yesterday trying to drum up some additional support among lawmakers among a clearly debate-fatigued public. Another net neutrality group, Fight for the Future, has constructed this page to track which lawmakers haven't signed on, while making it easy to contact those that haven't.

That said, this effort was always an uphill climb. Even if the CRA vote succeeded in the House, it would have to avoid a veto by Trump. Many activists I've spoken to believe a vote in both Houses would appeal to Trump's "populist" streak forcing him to bend to the whims of public consensus. But given Trump's version of populism tends to be as authentic as a Hollywood Wild West set and as consistent as a brush fire, that prediction always seemed a tad optimistic. Still, stranger things have happened, so maintaining hope in the face of this level of corruption isn't entirely outrageous.

That said, the best path forward for reversing the repeal is two fold. One, there remains a notable chance that the courts see the FCC's fraud-riddled net neutrality repeal as the blatant, facts-optional nonsense it actually is, and reverses it for being an "arbitrary and capricious" abuse of procedural norms and the FCC's obligation to represent the public. If that doesn't work, there's always voting in the the midterms and thereafter for a new breed of lawmakers that don't mindlessly place ISP campaign contributions above the welfare of the public, the internet, and genuine, healthy competition.ARTICLE:Orlando Airport’s Facial Scanning Progam Will Soon Cover All International FlightsARTICLE:Face scans, anyone?

A discharge petition needs 218 signatures to force a House vote on the same net neutrality bill, and 218 votes would also be enough to pass the measure. So far, the petition has signatures from 172 representatives, all Democrats. That number hasn't changed in two weeks.

"We're 46 [signatures] away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order," Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted yesterday.

California net neutrality bill

Another major legislative debate on net neutrality is happening in the California state legislature. A bill to impose strict net neutrality rules passed in the California Senate but was gutted by State Assembly lawmakers last week.

The gutted version of the bill was approved yesterday by the Assembly's Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee, but this was mainly a procedural move. Sen.

"To be clear, if the bill ultimately remains in its current form, I will withdraw it, as I have no desire to pass a fake net neutrality bill," Wiener said. "But my sincere hope is that we will be able to amend it in the near future back into a strong form."ARTICLE:WARREN, CAPUANO and CLARK to visit Texas border — BPS sued over potential ICE cooperation — PRESSLEY on PELOSIWARREN, CAPUANO and CLARK to visit Texas border — BPS sued over potential ICE cooperation — PRESSLEY on PELOSI

THE DELEGATION CONTINUES TO TAKE ON TRUMP — The week is ending the same way it began: With Massachusetts Democrats continuing to pound the pavement in opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

At least three members of the congressional delegation will be in Texas this weekend to protest.

Reps. Michael Capuano and Katherine Clark will visit the border between McAllen and Brownsville in a group of 20 Democratic members of Congress, according to their offices. The group plans to speak with children and parents who have been affected by President Donald Trump’s family separation policy while touring a border patrol station and centralized processing center, followed by an ICE Detention Center in Port Isabel. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also plans to visit the border in McAllen on Sunday, her team says.

Sen. Ed Markey has another press conference planned in immigrant-heavy East Boston with medical and health professionals to discuss the impacts of family separations on children at the southern border. Massachusetts itself currently has no immigrant children separated from their parents at the border, Gov. Charlie Baker told reporters yesterday.

And Attorney General Maura Healey has filed another lawsuit against the Trump administration. This time, she’s among 11 attorneys general suing the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and relevant Trump Administration officials “over their illegal and immoral policy of forcibly separating children from their families at the southern border,” according to Healey’s office. The suit was filed in US District Court in Washington state yesterday.

ARTICLE:‘Vote her in next, Massachusetts’ — $15 minimum wage, paid family leave ballot questions to be dropped — KENNEDY joins hunger strike‘Vote her in next, Massachusetts’ — $15 minimum wage, paid family leave ballot questions to be dropped — KENNEDY joins hunger strike

By Lauren Dezenski (ldezenski@politico.com; @LaurenDezenski) with Brent D. Griffiths (bgriffiths@politico.com; @BrentGriffiths)

GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

NY-14’S MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTION — A progressive woman of color, facing institutional opposition and a significant fundraising gap, wages a long-shot bid against a 10-term, scandal-free white male incumbent. Sounds a lot like Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley’s campaign to unseat Rep. Michael Capuano in Massachusetts’ 7th District, right?

But those were the contours in New York’s 14th District, where 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decisively defeated Rep. Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary last night. There’s even a Massachusetts connection to the winning campaign — Pressley sent her field director to work on GOTV for Ocasio-Cortez in the last week of the race.

Ocasio-Cortez herself is already leaning into the parallels between her bid and Pressley’s, tweeting just before 2 a.m. this morning, “‘The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.’ - @AyannaPressley. Vote her in next, Massachusetts. There are more of us, too: @CoriBush, @Chardo2018, @AyannaPressley & more. … We need to elect a corporate PAC-free caucus if we’re going to get things done.”

If nothing else, last night’s result in NY-14 serves a cautionary tale about the first incumbent Democrat unseated by a primary challenger this year. Just as in the Pressley-Capuano race, Ocasio-Cortez questioned whether Crowley’s identity as a white male incumbent made him the right fit for such a diverse, majority-minority district.

Yet there are important differences between the two contests — Capuano is no Crowley. While Crowley raised millions this cycle, he showed few signs of taking the primary challenge seriously. Crowley skipped two debates, sending a surrogate to one of them, and spurring a rebuke from the New York Times editorial board days before the election. Capuano, meanwhile, has moved aggressively to lock down — especially from those who might have potentially backed Pressley like Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, and former Gov. Deval Patrick. The politics in Massachusetts are different too. Crowley was seen as a more moderate Democrat — Capuano is one of the few liberal members of Congress who didn’t even attend Trump’s inauguration.

And Pressley is no Ocasio-Cortez. The New York political newcomer is a Democratic Socialist, still closely tied to the Bernie Sanders coalition. There is some policy and demographic overlap (both call for the abolition of ICE, for example) Pressley, a Clinton supporter, has been more aligned to the institutional core of the Democratic party. Those looking for a Massachusetts congressional candidate with the Bernie Sanders bonafides of Ocasio-Cortez ought to check out Tahirah Amatul-Wadud (who happens to be challenging Rep. Richard Neal in the western part of the state).

Still, Ocasio-Cortez’s win is a major boost to the Pressley campaign (as well as Amatul-Wadud’s). In the very least, it will help convince would-be backers (and donors) to jump onto a not-quite-as-longshot congressional bid as we head into the last two months of the primary.

THE KENNEDY COMPOUND —

– “90-year-old Ethel Kennedy joins hunger strike against immigration policies,” by J.D.

GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

PRESSLEY’S OCASIO-CORTEZ BUMP — The buzz from a New York Democratic primary upset against a powerful, 10-term incumbent in New York has already delivered an instant boost for Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley’s own bid against Rep. Michael Capuano.

Pressley’s campaign tells me it’s seen a burst of interest over the last 24 hours thanks to the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez victory over Rep. Joe Crowley. Website traffic at AyannaPressley.com has spiked 56 percent – most of which came from people Googling Pressley, and the candidate has gained 4,000 new followers on Twitter and at least 100 new small-dollar donations. That’s on top of new volunteers streaming into the recently opened campaign headquarters in Jamaica Plain. They’ve “been putting folks who didn’t know ‘AP’ yesterday to work all day,” according to Pressley campaign manager Sarah Groh.

Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez met in person on June 6. They initially connected over Twitter this spring, and met in real life at a star-studded Manhattan fundraiser for Pressley hosted by musician Questlove, comedian Amy Schumer, founding Chief Communications Officer of Everytown for Gun Safety Erika Soto Lamb and actress Amber Tamblyn. Both Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez attended Boston University (though at different times — Ocasio-Cortez is 28 and Pressley is 44).

A week before New York’s primary election day, Pressley sent a campaign staffer to Queens to work on GOTV operations for Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign. Now, with 68 days left until the primary, Pressley’s campaign is open to a similar move from Ocasio-Cortez, but told me it is not expecting reciprocity.

Young, State House News Service: “As lawmakers mull the impacts of a US Supreme Court ruling seen as a devastating blow to public sector labor unions, the Massachusetts House is hoping labor leaders will suggest ways the Legislature can respond and soften the blow. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Wednesday in Janus v.

Yesterday, the Herald confirmed that state police questioned A.J. Baker after he was taken off the flight last week and wrote a report. The Boston Globe first reported details of that report after it was unofficially leaked yesterday. ”

Sanders and Warren call for a living wage for resort workers,” by Hugo Martin, LA Times: “The dispute over living wages at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim has spread to the halls of Congress in Washington.

THE LOCAL ANGLE —

– “Key evidence in alleged trooper overtime scam came from cruiser radios,” by Martin Finucane, Boston Globe: “The three Massachusetts state troopers who are facing federal embezzlement charges for allegedly charging tens of thousands of dollars of fake overtime were betrayed by trusted tools: their cruisers and their radios, according to federal investigators. Records from the radios were a key part of the paper trail laid out in the affidavits supporting the criminal complaints against the troopers. ”

–“Mediator again seeks elusive compromise on Housatonic River cleanup,” by Larry Parnass, The Berkshire Eagle: “Same problem. Same disputing parties. Same mediator. It begs the question: Is a breakthrough possible on the region's costliest environmental disaster? The last time attorney John G.

ARTICLE:Good news for INCUMBENTS — ‘RED FLAG’ gun bill heads to BAKER’s desk — WARREN, KENNEDY to rally against family separationsGood news for INCUMBENTS — ‘RED FLAG’ gun bill heads to BAKER’s desk — WARREN, KENNEDY to rally against family separations

By Lauren Dezenski (ldezenski@politico.com; @LaurenDezenski) with Brent D. Griffiths (bgriffiths@politico.com; @BrentGriffiths)

GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

PROGRAMMING NOTE — The Massachusetts Playbook will be in the highly capable hands of Stephanie Murray and Brent Griffiths next week while I head out of town on vacation. Send them your scoops, tips, and takes posthaste to smurray@politico.com and bgriffiths@politico.com and I look forward my well-rested return to your inbox on July 9.

SO FAR THIS YEAR, IT’S GOOD TO BE AN INCUMBENT — We’re approaching the dog-days of the summer campaign season, yet a key tenet has held fast throughout the primary: Gov. Charlie Baker is extremely popular. Meanwhile, his challengers — and challenges to incumbents across the board — continue to struggle to break through to voters.

New polling shows that Baker is even more popular among Democrats. The poll, conducted by MassINC Polling Group and WBUR shows that Baker’s favorable rating among Democratic primary voters, at 68 percent, is slightly higher than his favorable rating among Republican primary voters at 66 percent.

As MassINC pollster Steve Koczela put it recently , it’s “not out of the question Charlie Baker would win a statewide Democratic primary in MA.”

Another key data point: Up and down the ticket, challengers to incumbents are struggling to get traction. In the Democratic primary matchup between Bob Massie and Jay Gonzalez, 61 percent of voters remain undecided, while just 16 percent support Gonzalez and 13 percent support Massie.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren remains incredibly popular, though just among Democrats. The senior senator has a 79 percent favorability among Democratic primary voters, compared to an 11 percent favorability among Republican primary voters.

Among Republican primary voters, 48 percent are still undecided when it comes to her potential opponents. Geoff Diehl has an edge with 23 percent support compared to Beth Lindstrom’s 13 percent and John Kingston’s 12 percent.

In the most closely watched (and admittedly somewhat inside-baseball) race for secretary of state in a generation, more than 20 years of incumbency are proving to be a boon to Secretary of State Bill Galvin. Despite an aggressive challenge (and Democratic state convention endorsement win) by Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim, Galvin currently has 46 percent support among Democratic primary voters to Zakim’s 17 percent.

ARTICLE:GRAND BARGAIN now awaits BAKER’s signature — HEALEY wants to investigate Bristol sheriff — DOLAN lands at GALVIN campaignGRAND BARGAIN now awaits BAKER’s signature — HEALEY wants to investigate Bristol sheriff — DOLAN lands at GALVIN campaign

By Lauren Dezenski (ldezenski@politico.com; @LaurenDezenski) with Brent D. Griffiths (bgriffiths@politico.com; @BrentGriffiths)

GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

ICYMI — The Grand Bargain is out — and is already on the governor’s desk ready to be signed into law after already passing both the House and the Senate on Wednesday. Gov. Charlie Baker now has 10 days to act on the compromise bill. Advocates have already said they will agree to the Grand Bargain’s legislative compromises for the paid family medical leave and sales tax decrease, rather than appear as ballot questions. The initiative most likely to head to the ballot is the $15 minimum wage proposal. But Raise Up Massachusetts, the group behind the proposal, say it will decide by early next week whether or not they will remove their question from the ballot by agreeing with the Grand Bargain.

MEANWHILE — Furor over the Trump administration’s immigration policy spilled into the State House yesterday as hundreds flooded Beacon Hill, marching in opposition to the policy.

The group then entered the State House and decamped outside of Gov. Charlie Baker’s office, calling on him to act. Protest organizers, including the ACLU of Massachusetts and MIRA, support the safe communities legislation passed by the Senate that would prevent police from rounding up immigrants — a so-called sanctuary state measure.

The Senate adopted another resolution yesterday condemning the family separation policy and many senators joined the protesters chanting in the halls of the State House.

The imbroglio even prompted one Republican to leave the party. Former US Senate candidate Brian Herr tweeted he was leaving the GOP to register as an independent voter. “Using children to advance political agendas is immoral and sad beyond belief!” Herr tweeted . “Where have the positive leaders gone in the USA?” Herr was the Republican challenger to Sen. Ed Markey in 2014.

It also spurred business groups that were vocal critics of the Trump administration’s travel ban to speak out again. “Today the nation is faced with a policy that is even more abhorrent, separating immigrant children from their parents, and we feel compelled to speak out again,” The Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce and Massachusetts Business Roundtable said in a statement. “We urge the Administration to immediately end this policy.”

Trump’s executive order signed last night that would now keep migrant families together is still unacceptable to members of Massachusetts’ congressional delegation, who were critical of Trump’s immigration policy from the get-go. As Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted last night: “This isn’t over. Thousands of kids have been ripped from their parents with no plan to reunite them. And now @realdonaldtrump wants to create new detention camps for families. Separating kids is unacceptable — but indefinite imprisonment of families is still cruel & inhumane.”

ARTICLE:CBP: Orlando is first U.S. airport to scan faces of all international travelersOrlando International Airport will become the first U.S. airport to process all arriving and departing passengers with facial-recognition equipment, officials announced Thursday.

The move represents an expansion of a Customs and Border Protection experimental program that already placed cameras at 13 airports to screen passengers leaving the country or returning from overseas.

The verification process, where a camera scans the traveler’s face to compare it to Department of Homeland Security travel databases, takes less than 2 seconds and has a 99 percent match rate, according to CBP.

“We are at a critical turning point in the implementation of a biometric entry-exit system, and we’ve found a path forward that transforms travel for all travelers,” CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said.

The goal is to electronically screen passengers quickly and efficiently. One advantage is that the cameras are small and easy to install.

But privacy advocates question how the images will be used and how a traveler will be treated if rejected by the equipment.

U.S. citizens at these airports can opt out, but the agency "doesn't seem to be doing an adequate job letting Americans know they can opt out," said Harrison Rudolph, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center.

"We're not talking about one gate," he said. "We're talking about every international departure gate, which is a huge expansion of the number of people who will be scanned. Errors tend to go up as uses go up."

Two U.S. senators sent a letter last month to the Department of Homeland Security urging that formal rules be implemented before the program is expanded.

"It will also ensure a full vetting of this potentially sweeping program that could impact every American leaving the country by airport," said the letter from Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Mike Lee, R-Utah.

CBP said it is committed to its privacy obligations and has taken steps to safeguard the privacy of all travelers, limiting the amount of personally identifiable information used.

Phil Brown, CEO of the Greater Orlando Airport Authority, said the technology is part of a premier travel experience for 5 million international visitors per year.

“By incorporating biometric technology into our entry and exit processes, safety, security and speed are optimized so customers can enjoy a more streamlined and comfortable journey through Florida’s busiest airport,” Brown said.

Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, called the program a great step in making travel more efficient in the country’s most-visited travel region.

"Passengers traveling to and from Orlando will immediately enjoy a more efficient screening process and shorter wait times. This is also a win for our national security, as it provides an accurate way to identify individuals while combatting the use of falsified documents.

Other U.S. airports where CBP has facial-recognition equipment are Miami, Atlanta, New York JFK, San Diego, Houston Intercontinental and Hobby, Washington Dulles, Las Vegas and Chicago O’Hare.

The equipment is also at Preclearance airports overseas, where travelers clear customs and immigration before getting on the plane, in Aruba, Abu Dhabi and Ireland’s Shannon and Dublin airports.

CBP has partnerships with Delta Air Lines, Jet Blue Airways, British Airways, Lufthansa and Air New Zealand to advance biometric exit.
