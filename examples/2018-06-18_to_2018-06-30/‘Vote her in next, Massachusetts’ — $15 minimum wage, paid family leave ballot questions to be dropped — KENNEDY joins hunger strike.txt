‘Vote her in next, Massachusetts’ — $15 minimum wage, paid family leave ballot questions to be dropped — KENNEDY joins hunger strike

GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

NY-14’S MASSACHUSETTS CONNECTION — A progressive woman of color, facing institutional opposition and a significant fundraising gap, wages a long-shot bid against a 10-term, scandal-free white male incumbent. Sounds a lot like Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley’s campaign to unseat Rep. Michael Capuano in Massachusetts’ 7th District, right?

But those were the contours in New York’s 14th District, where 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decisively defeated Rep. Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary last night. There’s even a Massachusetts connection to the winning campaign — Pressley sent her field director to work on GOTV for Ocasio-Cortez in the last week of the race.

Ocasio-Cortez herself is already leaning into the parallels between her bid and Pressley’s, tweeting just before 2 a.m. this morning, “‘The people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.’ - @AyannaPressley. Vote her in next, Massachusetts. There are more of us, too: @CoriBush, @Chardo2018, @AyannaPressley & more. … We need to elect a corporate PAC-free caucus if we’re going to get things done.”

If nothing else, last night’s result in NY-14 serves a cautionary tale about the first incumbent Democrat unseated by a primary challenger this year. Just as in the Pressley-Capuano race, Ocasio-Cortez questioned whether Crowley’s identity as a white male incumbent made him the right fit for such a diverse, majority-minority district.

Yet there are important differences between the two contests — Capuano is no Crowley. While Crowley raised millions this cycle, he showed few signs of taking the primary challenge seriously. Crowley skipped two debates, sending a surrogate to one of them, and spurring a rebuke from the New York Times editorial board days before the election. Capuano, meanwhile, has moved aggressively to lock down — especially from those who might have potentially backed Pressley like Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, and former Gov. Deval Patrick. The politics in Massachusetts are different too. Crowley was seen as a more moderate Democrat — Capuano is one of the few liberal members of Congress who didn’t even attend Trump’s inauguration.

And Pressley is no Ocasio-Cortez. The New York political newcomer is a Democratic Socialist, still closely tied to the Bernie Sanders coalition. There is some policy and demographic overlap (both call for the abolition of ICE, for example) Pressley, a Clinton supporter, has been more aligned to the institutional core of the Democratic party. Those looking for a Massachusetts congressional candidate with the Bernie Sanders bonafides of Ocasio-Cortez ought to check out Tahirah Amatul-Wadud (who happens to be challenging Rep. Richard Neal in the western part of the state).

Still, Ocasio-Cortez’s win is a major boost to the Pressley campaign (as well as Amatul-Wadud’s). In the very least, it will help convince would-be backers (and donors) to jump onto a not-quite-as-longshot congressional bid as we head into the last two months of the primary.
