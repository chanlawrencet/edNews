GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

ICYMI — The Grand Bargain is out — and is already on the governor’s desk ready to be signed into law after already passing both the House and the Senate on Wednesday. Gov. Charlie Baker now has 10 days to act on the compromise bill. Advocates have already said they will agree to the Grand Bargain’s legislative compromises for the paid family medical leave and sales tax decrease, rather than appear as ballot questions. The initiative most likely to head to the ballot is the $15 minimum wage proposal. But Raise Up Massachusetts, the group behind the proposal, say it will decide by early next week whether or not they will remove their question from the ballot by agreeing with the Grand Bargain.

MEANWHILE — Furor over the Trump administration’s immigration policy spilled into the State House yesterday as hundreds flooded Beacon Hill, marching in opposition to the policy.

The group then entered the State House and decamped outside of Gov. Charlie Baker’s office, calling on him to act. Protest organizers, including the ACLU of Massachusetts and MIRA, support the safe communities legislation passed by the Senate that would prevent police from rounding up immigrants — a so-called sanctuary state measure.

The Senate adopted another resolution yesterday condemning the family separation policy and many senators joined the protesters chanting in the halls of the State House.

The imbroglio even prompted one Republican to leave the party. Former US Senate candidate Brian Herr tweeted he was leaving the GOP to register as an independent voter. “Using children to advance political agendas is immoral and sad beyond belief!” Herr tweeted . “Where have the positive leaders gone in the USA?” Herr was the Republican challenger to Sen. Ed Markey in 2014.

It also spurred business groups that were vocal critics of the Trump administration’s travel ban to speak out again. “Today the nation is faced with a policy that is even more abhorrent, separating immigrant children from their parents, and we feel compelled to speak out again,” The Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce and Massachusetts Business Roundtable said in a statement. “We urge the Administration to immediately end this policy.”

Trump’s executive order signed last night that would now keep migrant families together is still unacceptable to members of Massachusetts’ congressional delegation, who were critical of Trump’s immigration policy from the get-go. As Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted last night: “This isn’t over. Thousands of kids have been ripped from their parents with no plan to reunite them. And now @realdonaldtrump wants to create new detention camps for families. Separating kids is unacceptable — but indefinite imprisonment of families is still cruel & inhumane.”
