GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

PROGRAMMING NOTE — The Massachusetts Playbook will be in the highly capable hands of Stephanie Murray and Brent Griffiths next week while I head out of town on vacation. Send them your scoops, tips, and takes posthaste to smurray@politico.com and bgriffiths@politico.com and I look forward my well-rested return to your inbox on July 9.

SO FAR THIS YEAR, IT’S GOOD TO BE AN INCUMBENT — We’re approaching the dog-days of the summer campaign season, yet a key tenet has held fast throughout the primary: Gov. Charlie Baker is extremely popular. Meanwhile, his challengers — and challenges to incumbents across the board — continue to struggle to break through to voters.

New polling shows that Baker is even more popular among Democrats. The poll, conducted by MassINC Polling Group and WBUR shows that Baker’s favorable rating among Democratic primary voters, at 68 percent, is slightly higher than his favorable rating among Republican primary voters at 66 percent.

As MassINC pollster Steve Koczela put it recently , it’s “not out of the question Charlie Baker would win a statewide Democratic primary in MA.”

Another key data point: Up and down the ticket, challengers to incumbents are struggling to get traction. In the Democratic primary matchup between Bob Massie and Jay Gonzalez, 61 percent of voters remain undecided, while just 16 percent support Gonzalez and 13 percent support Massie.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren remains incredibly popular, though just among Democrats. The senior senator has a 79 percent favorability among Democratic primary voters, compared to an 11 percent favorability among Republican primary voters.

Among Republican primary voters, 48 percent are still undecided when it comes to her potential opponents. Geoff Diehl has an edge with 23 percent support compared to Beth Lindstrom’s 13 percent and John Kingston’s 12 percent.

In the most closely watched (and admittedly somewhat inside-baseball) race for secretary of state in a generation, more than 20 years of incumbency are proving to be a boon to Secretary of State Bill Galvin. Despite an aggressive challenge (and Democratic state convention endorsement win) by Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim, Galvin currently has 46 percent support among Democratic primary voters to Zakim’s 17 percent.
