ARTICLE:The EPA Is Hiding Proof That a Widely Used Chemical Causes Leukemia: ReportARTICLE:EPA accused of ‘suppressing’ hazardous formaldehyde reportEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials have accused staff appointed by departing agency head Scott Pruitt of suppressing a report warning that most Americans are exposed to hazardous levels of formaldehyde.

The draft report was completed by EPA scientists over a year ago. It claims that most Americans inhale enough formaldehyde vapor day-to-day to put them at risk of developing leukemia, nose cancer, throat cancer, and other ailments, Politico reported.

Formaldehyde is commonly used in the manufacture of wood composites and resins, like those found in cabinets and furniture. It can also be found in some disinfectants, food preservatives, cosmetics and cigarettes. Humans can also be exposed to its vapor by inhaling the emissions of refineries.

Formaldehyde is already “known to be a human carcinogen” by the US National Toxicology Program, but the EPA’s delayed report could potentially reveal harmful effects at lower exposures. This could lead to tighter regulations on manufacturers, new workplace exposure guidelines, or class-action lawsuits from people unwittingly exposed to the chemical.

Two anonymous officials said that Pruitt’s political appointees at the agency are “stonewalling” the report, delaying its release at “every step of the way.”

The report was authored by the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), a politically independent body of around 35 scientists within the agency. After IRIS completes a study, a report is then sent to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for review. After passing muster with the NAS, the report can then inform policy.

In the case of the formaldehyde report, the NAS has already been paid $500,000 to carry out the review. The EPA has thus far refused to hand over the report, however.

The anonymous officials, who spoke to Politico, blame Pruitt’s appointees and industry lobbyists for the delay. The appointees, they say, are cancelling briefings on the report, and refusing to let staff carry out important revisions on it without permission. Meanwhile, lobbyists like the American Chemistry Council (ACC) have written to the agency, warning against releasing the report “prematurely” and urging IRIS to incorporate industry-funded research downplaying the risks of formaldehyde.

Nearly a million jobs “depend on the use of formaldehyde,” the Council’s letter stated.

In response to the Politico story, the ACC released a statement on Friday calling the draft IRIS document “closer to science fiction than sound science.”

“Incredibly, the IRIS program would have you believe the amount of formaldehyde humans produce and exhale – in every single breath – is dangerous and could cause leukemia. There is no scientific evidence to support that outrageous allegation,” the ACC said.

Members of the American Chemistry Council include Exxon Mobil and Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC, and the organization has previously lobbied against IRIS. Nancy Beck, head of the EPA’s chemical safety office and a Pruitt appointee, is a former employee of the ACC.

“If the administration was really keen on protecting public health, why wouldn’t they send this to the National Academy and give it a really good review?” asked one former EPA official. “If it survives that review, then there’s a public health problem that needs to be dealt with, and if it doesn’t survive the review, then they can point the finger at IRIS and say, ‘You’re dead.’”

Democrats have noticed the delay, and urged the EPA and the Trump administration to expedite the report. “Why is the Trump administration keeping important health & safety information from parents and families?” tweeted Senator Chuck Schumer (D-New York) on Friday.

If the report is ready to move forward, why is the Trump administration keeping important health & safety information from parents and families? https://t.co/G0bwKp9y7r — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 6, 2018

“Because formaldehyde can be found in everything from wood products to women’s hair straighteners, the public health risks are substantial,” Senator Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement.

Pruitt resigned from the EPA on Thursday, citing “unprecedented” and “unrelenting” attacks on him and his family. During his tenure at the agency, Pruitt was hounded by negative news stories. Earlier this week, he was confronted in a Washington DC restaurant by a teacher and activist who urged him to resign “before your scandals push you out.”

As head of the EPA, he presided over substantial rollbacks of environmental regulations, as well as the US’ withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords.

Former EPA deputy Andrew Wheeler will be the agency’s new acting chief as of Monday, and looks set to continue in the vein of Pruitt. A former coal lobbyist, Wheeler was staff director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2004 when Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) tried to delay an earlier report on formaldehyde.

Already, Democrats have shifted their pressure campaign from Pruitt to Wheeler.

About. Damn. Time.

Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!ARTICLE:Here’s How Fox & Friends (Barely) Covered Scott Pruitt’s Scandal-Plagued OusterIt’s widely known that Fox & Friends is President Donald Trump‘s favorite morning show. Why? Friday’s episode provides an answer. For after yet another Trump cabinet official was ousted, following a massive pile-up of bizarre scandals which roiled his leadership for months, the show barely even mentioned it.

The story isn’t a small one: EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt finally “resigned” after months of scandals over his spending and behavior at the agency (spurring at least 13 federal investigations), marking the departure of yet another Trump administration official. It was further evidence of deeply chaotic mismanagement within the administration, and another ding to Trump’s farcical “Drain the Swamp” rhetoric.

Nonetheless, the story went mostly unacknowledged on the top-rated cable news morning show. Its three main hosts didn’t mention Pruitt’s departure once. It was confined to the “headlines” portion of the show — sandwiched in between stories about ICE and wildfires.

The Pruitt resignation was briefly covered by Jillian Mele, who cast the story with a — shall we say — inventive angle:

“New EPA chief Andrew Wheeler hasn’t been on the job for 24 hours and already being attacked. The left going after Wheeler’s ties to the coal industry after celebrating Scott Pruitt’s resignation. Massachusetts Democratic Senator Ed Markey tweeting, ‘About. Damn. Time. With Pruitt out and Andrew Wheeler at the helm, the EPA Administrator will no longer be #BigOil’s right hand man, it’ll be King Coal’s best lobbyist.'”

The Pruitt story is one of of heinous government excess and insider dealing that would have been wonderfully juicy Fox & Friends fodder during the Obama administration. In the Trump era, it’s confined to a throwaway headline, mentioned only to highlight Democratic opposition to the administration. The scandals got so out of control that Pruitt was condemned by Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, and the network’s other programs covered his ouster. Fox & Friends less.

A reminder: Pruitt somehow survived in his position leading the Environmental Protection Agency for months, despite a steady flow of whistleblowers revealing his bizarre practices and absurd expenditures, which included sending staffers to pick up a used mattress at Trump Hotel and his favorite lotions from the Ritz; trying to use his position to get his wife a series of jobs, including one as a Chik-fil-A franchisee; spending $40k on a phone booth, $3k on “tactical pants,” $1.5k on fountain pens and $120k on a trip to Italy where he dined with a Catholic Cardinal abused of sexual abuse. The list goes on.

Of the more than one dozen investigations into Pruitt’s behavior, the one that has been completed found that he broke the law. He will be replaced by Wheeler, who is a veteran coal lobbyist.

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.comARTICLE:Insiders Admit Trump's EPA Burying Cancer-Causing Chemical Study Unfriendly to IndustryNew reporting in Politico puts the spotlight on continued themes of the Trump administration: suppression of science, threats to public health, and carrying out the bidding of industry. The issue laid out involves alleged political interference at the Environmental Protection Agency, and while the agency's current administrator, scandal-riddled Scott Pruitt, is now on his way out the door, the reins now head to number two Andrew Wheeler, who offers little reason to believe the burying of a key report will soon end.

As Politico's Annie Snider reported, Trump appointees at the agency are blocking the release of an assessment on formaldehyde produced by the EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). A draft assessment already completed confirms research linking the common chemical to leukemia, nose and throat cancer, and other adverse health effects.

"They're stonewalling every step of the way," an anonymous current official at EPA told Politico.

Because the political aides are suppressing the assessment, they're preventing it from moving on to required review by the National Academies of Sciences (NAS), an independent panel of top researchers—even though the EPA has already shelled out $500,000 to pay for that review. Why wouldn't it send off the assessment to NAS? "You don't want the answer," an anonymous former EPA official told Politico.

According to internal documents seen by the publication, a chemical industry group urged the EPA to bury the findings. In a Jan. 26 letter to top EPA officials, Kimberly Wise White, who leads the American Chemistry Council's Formaldehyde Panel, wrote, "As stated in our meeting, a premature release of a draft assessment … will cause irreparable harm to the companies represented by the panel and to the many companies and jobs that depend on the broad use of the chemical."

"The new assessment," as Snider reported, "would give greater weight to warnings about the chemical's risks and could lead to stricter regulations from the EPA or class-action lawsuits targeting its manufacturers, as frequently occurs after these types of studies are released."

EPA spokeswoman Kelsi Daniell brushed off the assertion that the assessment was being suppressed, telling Politico that the agency "continues to discuss this assessment with our agency program partners and have no further updates to provide at this time." But that runs counter to Pruitt's testimony in January before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, when he told Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) that his understanding was that the report was ready for public review and did, in fact, link formaldehyde to leukemia and other cancers.

However, several months after that hearing Markey and other members of that committee—Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Ranking Member Tom Carper (D-Del.)—sent a letter to Pruitt in May asking him to explain why the assessment had still not been released. They also pointed a finger at two of the same alleged culprits behind the suppression as named in the Politico reporting: EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson and Nancy Beck, deputy assistant administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. Beck, as Politico reported, "criticized the IRIS program in her previous job as a top chemical industry expert."

In addition to those appointeses, the senators also say they believe the American Chemistry Council "as well as interested corporations such a Exxon Mobil have been pressuring EPA not to release the assessment for public comment as drafted."

As for Wheeler, Politico noted that he "was staff director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2004, when his boss, then-Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), sought to delay an earlier iteration of the formaldehyde assessment." As ProPublica previously reported, that stalling occurred "even though preliminary findings from a National Cancer Institute study had already linked formaldehyde to leukemia. Inhofe insisted that the EPA wait for a more 'robust set of findings' from the institute." Those "robust findings," released 5 years later, however, merely backed up the earlier findings.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for her part, warned in a tweet Friday that Wheeler is "just as dirty" as Pruitt, and "is a former coal lobbyist who will work to poison the agency—and the environment he's supposed to protect— from the inside."ARTICLE:Scott Pruitt is leaving behind a toxic mess at the EPAARTICLE:EPA officials claim political interference in cancer-causing chemical study: reportOfficials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) say that political appointees put in place by departing administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: EPA nominees begin work before they are confirmed | Wheeler promises ‘change in tone’ at EPA | GOP group pushes vote on anti-carbon tax bill Pruitt’s only saving grace was an inability to advance his proposals — Wheeler won’t have that problem Acting EPA chief promises ‘change in tone,’ new emphasis on transparency MORE are slowing the release of a report warning that most Americans are exposed to enough formaldehyde on a regular basis to increase risks of cancer.

One current and one former EPA official told Politico that Pruitt's appointees are stonewalling the report's release "every step of the way" over concerns that the report's release would have a negative impact on businesses that use the chemical.

“EPA continues to discuss this assessment with our agency program partners and have no further updates to provide at this time," EPA spokeswoman Kelsi Daniell told Politico. “Assessments of this type are often the result of needs for particular rulemakings and undergo an extensive intra-agency and interagency process.”

Pruitt's appointees are reportedly blocking the report from being reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences, an independent panel of top scientists who have already been paid $500,000 to complete the review of the report. The EPA has yet to transfer the report to the scientists to begin the review.

“If the administration was really keen on protecting public health, why wouldn’t they send this to the National Academy and give it a really good review?” a former EPA official asked Politico, adding that there was only one reason to avoid submitting the report to the review panel: “You don’t want the answer.”

Pruitt told a Senate panel in January that the report was completed, meaning it is now almost five months since the EPA has taken any public action on the review, according to Politico.

Internal documents obtained by Politico show lobbying from the American Chemistry Council (ACC) urging the EPA to avoid releasing the report "prematurely."

“As stated in our meeting, a premature release of a draft assessment … will cause irreparable harm to the companies represented by the Panel and to the many companies and jobs that depend on the broad use of the chemical,” wrote the ACC's Kimberly Wise White.

Following the publication of Politico's report, the ACC issued a statement denying the connection between formaldehyde exposure and developing leukemia.

“The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence clearly demonstrates formaldehyde does not cause leukemia. The science shows the draft IRIS document is just plain wrong – closer to science fiction than sound science," the statement said.

Previous research has linked exposure to the chemical to an increased chance of developing leukemia.

Democrats and other critics of the Trump administration's management of the EPA urged the EPA to "move past politics" in statements to Politico regarding the report's burying.

"Because formaldehyde can be found in everything from wood products to women’s hair straighteners, the public health risks are substantial,” Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyEPA officials claim political interference in cancer-causing chemical study: report Lawmakers press Trump admin for list of migrant kids separated from families Dem lawmakers join nationwide protests against Trump immigration policies MORE (D) said in a statement. “Delaying the EPA’s latest assessment of the health risks of formaldehyde only further endangers the health of Americans."

The report confirms that formaldehyde is linked to leukemia, nose and throat cancer and other ailments, according to Politico's sources.

--Updated 7:45 p.m.ARTICLE:Trump administration intentionally delaying release of EPA cancer studyThe Trump administration is suppressing an Environmental Protection Agency report that warns that most Americans inhale enough formaldehyde vapor in the course of daily life to put them at risk of developing leukemia and other ailments, a current and a former agency official told POLITICO.The warnings are contained in a draft health assessment EPA scientists completed just before Donald Trump became president, according to the officials. They said top advisers to departing Administrator Scott Pruitt are delaying its release as part of a campaign to undermine the agency’s independent research into the health risks of toxic chemicals.Andrew Wheeler, the No. 2 official at EPA who will be the agency's new acting chief as of Monday, also has a history with the chemical. He was staff director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2004, when his boss, then-Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), sought to delay an earlier iteration of the formaldehyde assessment.Formaldehyde is one of the most commonly used chemicals in the country. Americans are exposed to it through wood composites in cabinets and furniture, as well as air pollution from major refineries. The new assessment would give greater weight to warnings about the chemical's risks and could lead to stricter regulations from the EPA or class-action lawsuits targeting its manufacturers, as frequently occurs after these types of studies are released.“They’re stonewalling every step of the way,” the current official said, accusing political appointees of interfering with the formaldehyde assessment and other reports on toxic chemicals produced by EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System. Industry has long faulted the IRIS program, the agency’s only independent scientific division evaluating the health risks of toxic chemicals, whose assessments often form the basis for federal and state regulations.The current official and former official requested anonymity out of fear for their jobs and the impact that speaking out could have on the IRIS program.Interfering with the formaldehyde study is one of several steps Trump's EPA has taken to side with the businesses the agency is supposed to regulate and undermine the agency's approach to science, critics say. Public health advocates also expressed alarm after Pruitt replaced academic scientists with industry advocates on the agency’s influential science advisory boards and sought to limit the types of human health research the EPA can rely on in rulemakings.The officials said Trump appointees have required that career officials receive their permission before beginning the required internal review of the formaldehyde study and have canceled key briefings that would have advanced it. That interference came after EPA career scientists revised the study once already last year to insulate it from political controversy, they said.In a statement, EPA denied that the assessment was being held back.“EPA continues to discuss this assessment with our agency program partners and have no further updates to provide at this time," EPA spokeswoman Kelsi Daniell said. “Assessments of this type are often the result of needs for particular rulemakings and undergo an extensive intra-agency and interagency process.”But as long ago as January, Pruitt told a Senate panel that he believed the draft assessment was complete.Five months later, it has yet to see the light of day. Meanwhile, internal documents show, a trade group representing businesses that could face new regulations and lawsuits if the study were released had frequent access to top EPA officials and pressed them to either keep it under wraps or change its findings.“As stated in our meeting, a premature release of a draft assessment … will cause irreparable harm to the companies represented by the Panel and to the many companies and jobs that depend on the broad use of the chemical,” Kimberly Wise White, who leads the American Chemistry Council’s Formaldehyde Panel, wrote in a Jan. 26 letter to top officials at the EPA. The panel represents companies including Exxon Mobil and the Koch Industries subsidiary Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC that could face higher costs from stricter regulations or lawsuits.Nearly a million jobs “depend on the use of formaldehyde,” White’s letter argued.The holdup is attracting attention on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have already expressed alarm, arguing that the Trump administration has allowed politics to interfere in EPA’s scientific assessments of threats such as toxic pollution and climate change.The agency must “move past politics and focus on its job of protecting human health” by releasing the formaldehyde study, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement to POLITICO."Because formaldehyde can be found in everything from wood products to women’s hair straighteners, the public health risks are substantial,” Markey said. “Delaying the EPA’s latest assessment of the health risks of formaldehyde only further endangers the health of Americans."Public health advocates have similarly expressed fears that the Trump administration has allowed EPA to be captured by the industries it regulates. The revelations about the formaldehyde study come after Pruitt removed academic scientists from the agency’s influential science advisory boards and in many cases replaced them with industry advocates, and after he proposed a policy to limit the agency's use of human health data while offering a carve-out for confidential industry studies.“At every corner, you see the agency trying to either minimize the role of science or manipulate the role of science or just ignore the work of scientists in doing the critical work to ensure that human health and the environment is protected,” said Jennifer McPartland, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund’s health program.ARTICLE:Formaldehyde causes cancer.

Pruitt told a Senate panel in January that the report was completed, meaning it is now almost five months since the EPA has taken any public action on the review, according to Politico.

Internal documents obtained by Politico show lobbying from the American Chemistry Council (ACC) urging the EPA to avoid releasing the report "prematurely."

“As stated in our meeting, a premature release of a draft assessment … will cause irreparable harm to the companies represented by the Panel and to the many companies and jobs that depend on the broad use of the chemical,” wrote the ACC's Kimberly Wise White.

Following the publication of Politico's report, the ACC issued a statement denying the connection between formaldehyde exposure and developing leukemia.

“The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence clearly demonstrates formaldehyde does not cause leukemia. The science shows the draft IRIS document is just plain wrong – closer to science fiction than sound science," the statement said.

Previous research has linked exposure to the chemical to an increased chance of developing leukemia.

Democrats and other critics of the Trump administration's management of the EPA urged the EPA to "move past politics" in statements to Politico regarding the report's burying.

"Because formaldehyde can be found in everything from wood products to women’s hair straighteners, the public health risks are substantial,” Massachusetts Sen.

The report confirms that formaldehyde is linked to leukemia, nose and throat cancer and other ailments, according to Politico's sources.

--Updated 7:45 p.m.ARTICLE:Trump administration intentionally delaying release of EPA cancer studyThe Trump administration is suppressing an Environmental Protection Agency report that warns that most Americans inhale enough formaldehyde vapor in the course of daily life to put them at risk of developing leukemia and other ailments, a current and a former agency official told POLITICO.The warnings are contained in a draft health assessment EPA scientists completed just before Donald Trump became president, according to the officials. They said top advisers to departing Administrator Scott Pruitt are delaying its release as part of a campaign to undermine the agency’s independent research into the health risks of toxic chemicals.Andrew Wheeler, the No. 2 official at EPA who will be the agency's new acting chief as of Monday, also has a history with the chemical. He was staff director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2004, when his boss, then-Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), sought to delay an earlier iteration of the formaldehyde assessment.Formaldehyde is one of the most commonly used chemicals in the country. Americans are exposed to it through wood composites in cabinets and furniture, as well as air pollution from major refineries. The new assessment would give greater weight to warnings about the chemical's risks and could lead to stricter regulations from the EPA or class-action lawsuits targeting its manufacturers, as frequently occurs after these types of studies are released.“They’re stonewalling every step of the way,” the current official said, accusing political appointees of interfering with the formaldehyde assessment and other reports on toxic chemicals produced by EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System. Industry has long faulted the IRIS program, the agency’s only independent scientific division evaluating the health risks of toxic chemicals, whose assessments often form the basis for federal and state regulations.The current official and former official requested anonymity out of fear for their jobs and the impact that speaking out could have on the IRIS program.Interfering with the formaldehyde study is one of several steps Trump's EPA has taken to side with the businesses the agency is supposed to regulate and undermine the agency's approach to science, critics say. Public health advocates also expressed alarm after Pruitt replaced academic scientists with industry advocates on the agency’s influential science advisory boards and sought to limit the types of human health research the EPA can rely on in rulemakings.The officials said Trump appointees have required that career officials receive their permission before beginning the required internal review of the formaldehyde study and have canceled key briefings that would have advanced it. That interference came after EPA career scientists revised the study once already last year to insulate it from political controversy, they said.In a statement, EPA denied that the assessment was being held back.“EPA continues to discuss this assessment with our agency program partners and have no further updates to provide at this time," EPA spokeswoman Kelsi Daniell said. “Assessments of this type are often the result of needs for particular rulemakings and undergo an extensive intra-agency and interagency process.”But as long ago as January, Pruitt told a Senate panel that he believed the draft assessment was complete.Five months later, it has yet to see the light of day. Meanwhile, internal documents show, a trade group representing businesses that could face new regulations and lawsuits if the study were released had frequent access to top EPA officials and pressed them to either keep it under wraps or change its findings.“As stated in our meeting, a premature release of a draft assessment … will cause irreparable harm to the companies represented by the Panel and to the many companies and jobs that depend on the broad use of the chemical,” Kimberly Wise White, who leads the American Chemistry Council’s Formaldehyde Panel, wrote in a Jan. 26 letter to top officials at the EPA. The panel represents companies including Exxon Mobil and the Koch Industries subsidiary Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC that could face higher costs from stricter regulations or lawsuits.Nearly a million jobs “depend on the use of formaldehyde,” White’s letter argued.The holdup is attracting attention on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have already expressed alarm, arguing that the Trump administration has allowed politics to interfere in EPA’s scientific assessments of threats such as toxic pollution and climate change.The agency must “move past politics and focus on its job of protecting human health” by releasing the formaldehyde study, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement to POLITICO."Because formaldehyde can be found in everything from wood products to women’s hair straighteners, the public health risks are substantial,” Markey said. “Delaying the EPA’s latest assessment of the health risks of formaldehyde only further endangers the health of Americans."Public health advocates have similarly expressed fears that the Trump administration has allowed EPA to be captured by the industries it regulates. The revelations about the formaldehyde study come after Pruitt removed academic scientists from the agency’s influential science advisory boards and in many cases replaced them with industry advocates, and after he proposed a policy to limit the agency's use of human health data while offering a carve-out for confidential industry studies.“At every corner, you see the agency trying to either minimize the role of science or manipulate the role of science or just ignore the work of scientists in doing the critical work to ensure that human health and the environment is protected,” said Jennifer McPartland, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund’s health program.ARTICLE:Formaldehyde causes cancer.
