We need 46 more Congressional votes to force a vote on restoring Net Neutrality

The Discharge Petition that cleared the Senate in May is struggling in the House (as we knew it would).

The petition needs 218 House signatures to force a vote on whether to overrule Ajit Pai and the FCC and bring back Net Neutrality. It's been stalled at 172 for two weeks.

Here's how to check where your rep stands. You can use the same tool to call your lawmaker and remind them that there's an election coming up and you don't appreciate anyone fucking with your internet, and you'll remember who stood up for Big Telco when the polls open.

A discharge petition needs 218 signatures to force a House vote on the same net neutrality bill, and 218 votes would also be enough to pass the measure. So far, the petition has signatures from 172 representatives, all Democrats. That number hasn't changed in two weeks. "We're 46 [signatures] away from being able to force a vote on the resolution to restore the Open Internet Order," Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) tweeted yesterday.
