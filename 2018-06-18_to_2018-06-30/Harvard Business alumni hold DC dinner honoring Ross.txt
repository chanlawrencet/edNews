VIPs spotted among the champagne flutes at the Washington, D.C., event included Sen.(D-Mass.), CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, former U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Elizabeth Bagley and Lamborghini CEO for the Americas Alessandro Farmeschi.

Ross made jokes with the ambassador about current events, including tensions with America’s southern neighbor over immigration and trade.

“The only way we should solve the dispute with Mexico is to give them California back,” Ross said.

After dinner, the gathering of approximately 30 political figures and D.C. socialites smoked “some cigars from the ambassador’s private collection,” a comment to which Ross raised his eyebrows, to laughs from the crowd.

“It is very nice of you to offer your own Cuban cigars, although I cannot say that in front of the secretary of Commerce,” commented Antonio Alves, the president of the Harvard Business School Club in Washington.
