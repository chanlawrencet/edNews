GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

Story Continued Below

THE DELEGATION CONTINUES TO TAKE ON TRUMP — The week is ending the same way it began: With Massachusetts Democrats continuing to pound the pavement in opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

At least three members of the congressional delegation will be in Texas this weekend to protest.

Reps. Michael Capuano and Katherine Clark will visit the border between McAllen and Brownsville in a group of 20 Democratic members of Congress, according to their offices. The group plans to speak with children and parents who have been affected by President Donald Trump’s family separation policy while touring a border patrol station and centralized processing center, followed by an ICE Detention Center in Port Isabel. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also plans to visit the border in McAllen on Sunday, her team says.

Sen. Ed Markey has another press conference planned in immigrant-heavy East Boston with medical and health professionals to discuss the impacts of family separations on children at the southern border. Massachusetts itself currently has no immigrant children separated from their parents at the border, Gov. Charlie Baker told reporters yesterday.

And Attorney General Maura Healey has filed another lawsuit against the Trump administration. This time, she’s among 11 attorneys general suing the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and relevant Trump Administration officials “over their illegal and immoral policy of forcibly separating children from their families at the southern border,” according to Healey’s office. The suit was filed in US District Court in Washington state yesterday.

Officials at the Cannabis Control Commission on Thursday afternoon granted the state’s first-ever recreational marijuana license to a cultivation facility in Milford operated by Sira Naturals. ”

– “What does the Supreme Court's Wayfair decision on online sales taxes mean for Massachusetts?,” by Shira Schoenberg, MassLive.com: “The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states can collect sales taxes from online retailers. Gov. Charlie Baker hailed the ruling as ‘a good day for states, and it's a good day for those in the retail space who have been for many years disadvantaged because of the two-tiered system.’ But the practical effect in Massachusetts may be more about providing clarity than gaining any substantial new revenue, since Massachusetts already started collecting taxes from online sales last year -- despite a lawsuit challenging those collections. ’”

– “Massachusetts Senate passes wage theft bill,” by Shira Schoenberg, MassLive.com: “The Massachusetts Senate passed a bill Thursday that will make it easier to prosecute wage theft cases. According to the labor groups that support the bill, an estimated $700 million in wages is stolen from 350,000 workers each year. ”

– “On the council, Zakim gets endorsements while Pressley left waiting,” by Milton J. Valencia, Boston Globe: “Following his upset win at his party’s endorsement convention this month, Democrat Josh Zakim continues to rake in support from local pols — rounding out a trio of endorsements from his fellow city councilors in his upstart challenge to longtime Secretary of State William Galvin. Meanwhile, the number of similar endorsements for his colleague, Ayanna Pressley, in her quest to unseat veteran US Representative Michael Capuano? That’s still to be determined. ”

– “Baker endorses Tedeschi in congressional race,” by Geoff Spillane, Cape Cod Times: “Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has endorsed Peter Tedeschi in his bid to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. William Keating, D-Mass., in the state’s 9th Congressional District. Tedeschi, a Republican from Marshfield who also owns a summer home on Nantucket, has vowed to take a bipartisanship approach in Washington if elected. ”

– “As former US Senate candidate bolts GOP, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker touts his particular brand,” by Gintautas Dumcius, MassLive.com: “Brian Herr, who four years ago ran as a Republican against US Sen. Ed Markey, left the GOP this week as President Donald Trump's administration carried out and then reversed a policy of separating immigrant children and parents at the US-Mexico border. Asked about Herr's departure from the Republican Party, Baker turned to touting his particular GOP brand, based on Bill Weld and Paul Cellucci, who had served as moderate Republican governors in Massachusetts. ”

– “Candidate Beth Lindstrom on Massachusetts Senate Race,” by Bloomberg News: “Beth Lindstrom, Massachusetts Republican Senate candidate, discusses her campaign and why she thinks she can beat incumbent Elizabeth Warren, a major player in the Democratic Senate delegation, in the November midterm elections.

– “A Mass. candidate tangles with radio hosts over whether President Trump is like Hitler,” by Joshua Miller, Boston Globe: “Democratic candidate for governor Jay Gonzalez’s campaign slogan is ‘Let’s Aim High!’ On Thursday, he may have aimed a little too, um, high, calling into WEEI’s Kirk & Callahan Show — hosted by Kirk Minihane and Gerry Callahan — and quickly sounding as if he regretted trying to tangle with the pugnacious hosts whose politics seem a long way from the Needham liberal. ”
