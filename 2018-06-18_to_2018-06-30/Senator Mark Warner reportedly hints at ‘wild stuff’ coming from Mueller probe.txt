As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner is in a position to know what, if anything, special counsel Robert Mueller has found during the course of his investigation into President Trump’s possible ties to Russia.

So Warner may not have been joking when, according to Politico, he made a joke about the Mueller probe at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event on Martha’s Vineyard over the weekend.

“If you get me one more glass of wine, I’ll tell you stuff only Bob Mueller and I know,” Warner reportedly told the 100 or so guests. “If you think you’ve seen wild stuff so far, buckle up. It’s going to be a wild couple of months.”

The Vineyard, which served as the summer White House during BarackObama’s administration, remains a popular destination for glad-handing lawmakers looking to raise money or just relax. Politico reports that Warner and attorney/businesswoman Connie Milstein hosted a party at Milstein’s Edgartown house that drew Democratic Senators Chris Coons, Michael Bennet, Sheldon Whitehouse, Doug Jones, Gary Peters, Chris Van Hollen, and Massachusetts’ own Ed Markey.
