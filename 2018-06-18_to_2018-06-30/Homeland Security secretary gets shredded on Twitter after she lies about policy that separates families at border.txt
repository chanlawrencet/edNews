As the debate rages on about the Trump administration's horrific policy of separating undocumented parents from their children as they attempt to cross the border between the United States and Mexico, the fight between officials and lawmakers has spilled over onto social media.

One tweet, in particular, from Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen, has served as a flashpoint. She tweeted on Sunday that the DHS doesn't "have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."

We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period. — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018

But images and videos across social media as well as a plethora of well-reported stories have offered substantial evidence to the contrary, relaying stories and even showing tent cities created for undocumented children separated from their families.

Here are photos of the tent city near El Paso that is housing immigrant children separated from their parents. Photos by @i_p_a_1 for the @TexasTribune.

Just visited the Brownsville Children's Facility. Trump Administration didn't let us talk to the kids and they even tried to stop me from recording outside the building. They are clearly sensitive about this trip. This place is packed with kids—over 100 taken from parents. pic.twitter.com/7RVP0ZgT8e — Chris Van Hollen (@ChrisVanHollen) June 18, 2018

What's more, journalists and lawmakers made note of previous comments Nielsen has made in defense of the same policy she tweeted doesn't exist.

"Nielsen said the department has ... a policy that it will refer everyone caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, even if they ... have small children. Any parents who are prosecuted ... will be separated from their children in the process." https://t.co/PiCVLVA2aF https://t.co/Nfs9a3oxxx — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 17, 2018

Kirstjen Nielsen yesterday: “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.” But in May 10, she defended the administration’s separation policy to NPR https://t.co/nLC5SY0DzB — Evan Siegfried (@evansiegfried) June 18, 2018

Nielsen didn't exactly help herself, either, on Monday morning by saying, "We will not apologize for doing out job."

Lawmakers have jumped in, calling out Nielsen and her statement, labeling it a lie, and challenging both the Trump administration and Nielsen to address the growing crisis that is spiraling out of control.

This is a lie. Period. https://t.co/KUUQyyU2kF — Katherine Clark (@RepKClark) June 18, 2018

You are a stone cold liar. https://t.co/JXKb7ppwwt — Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) June 18, 2018

This statement is false. There are thousands of separated families that prove otherwise. My office is working to reunite 3 mothers who were separated from their kids at the border. Will highlight these stories at this week’s family separation hearing. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/iZbAxDdDzG — Nanette D. Barragán (@RepBarragan) June 18, 2018

.@SecNielsen This is a LIE! The Members you are speaking on are at the Detention facilities! We are on the grounds at the border taking with officials... Why don’t you STOP typing Tweets in D.C and come to Texas and see for your self. This situation of heartbreaking! https://t.co/2oa1mO22hp — Sheila Jackson Lee (@JacksonLeeTX18) June 18, 2018

The Trump Administration’s family separation policy tore 2,000 families apart in six weeks but they won’t stop lying about it. https://t.co/gw9RwUVjx5 — Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) June 18, 2018

Retract this statement, Madame Secretary.



Yes, technically YOU are not at the border separating families YOURSELF. You are in charge of a policy that turns parents over to DOJ, resulting in the separation of children. You know this, and still - incredibly - sent out this tweet. https://t.co/CikreZ286K

This is a lie. There is no law. There is no court mandate. This is a policy made solely by this administration, and you can stop it right now. And every second you don’t you are directly responsible for unimaginable amounts of misery. Period. https://t.co/nf0lF9VEoO — Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) June 18, 2018
