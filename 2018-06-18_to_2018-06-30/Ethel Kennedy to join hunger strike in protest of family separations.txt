Robert Kennedy’s widow, Ethel Kennedy, will take part in a hunger strike protesting President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, according to a report.

Nearly 50 other members of the political family will be joining Kennedy, 90, during the Saturday fast, organized by activist groups in honor of the nearly 2,500 children separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border, the Boston Globe reported.

“We want to find a way for people who can’t go down to the border to actually do something themselves at home that is concrete and creates change, and this is what we’re calling on them to do,” said Kerry Kennedy, Ethel and Robert’s daughter and head of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group.

The hunger strike will last 24 hours and participants are asked to make a donation to the organization Break Bread Not Families in place of the food they would have eaten.

Kerry Kennedy said her mom is “very joyful” about fasting for the cause.

In a statement, Ethel Kennedy said the executive order Trump signed last week halting the separations was “not a time to declare victory and go home.”

“Generations of Americans did not toil and sacrifice to build a country where children and their parents are placed in cages to advance a cynical political agenda,” the statement said.

Her grandson, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, will also participate.

“For children being starved of contact with their parents, the irreparable harm inflicted by our government multiplies every single day kids remain separated from their moms and dads,” he said in a statement.

The hunger strike is organized by RFK Human Rights, which Ethel Kennedy founded, along with La Union Del Pueblo Entero, The Texas Civil Rights Project and Neta.

Celebrities including Alec Baldwin, Keegan-Michael Key and Evan Rachel Wood announced they would be participating, as well as both senators from Massachusets, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren.
